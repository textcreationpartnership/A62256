            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

And if upon peruſal of the evidence, you find it ſo, as is reported, that we are come to the days of the ſon of man, and are ſo far entred upon them; then for a farwel, be admoniſhed of this one <hi>thing,</hi> that as theſe days of the ſon of man are days of great <hi>expectation,</hi> wherein all things that are to precede his glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous coming, are to be fulfilled, and that before this generation paſſe away, ſo they are, and will be found, to be days of great <hi>temptation</hi> and <hi>tribulation</hi> to the laſt, even till the Lord appears in perſon from heaven; therefore as the expectation ſhould make us lookup, and lift up our heads, and concern our ſelves about theſe things, with a more then <hi>Ordinary</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern for that, as they are <hi>great,</hi> ſo they draw <hi>nigh</hi> (and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to our <hi>concern</hi> will our <hi>fruit</hi> be in <hi>this</hi> day;) ſo the temptation calls us to more then ordinary <hi>circumſpection</hi> and watchfulneſs, therefore our Saviour <hi>inculcates</hi> that warning ſo often, in ſpeaking of this day; and that to <hi>his diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples,</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:57576:5"/>laying before them the <hi>danger</hi> if they do not, and the ſafety and <hi>advantages</hi> if they do: <hi>Luk. 21.34, 35, 36. ch. 12.35, 36.37, 38, Mark. 13.33.</hi> to the end of the chapter. And where the Lord ſhews ſuch a concern (as he doth about this watching) there to think, that <hi>watching</hi> and <hi>not watching</hi> will come to the <hi>ſame reckoning,</hi> argues a great <hi>ſlieghtneſs,</hi> if not a <hi>profaneneſs</hi> of ſpirit. Though ye be believers, as to the <hi>main,</hi> and your part in heaven cannot be taken from you, yet ye may loſe your part in <hi>theſe days,</hi> and may be <hi>removed</hi> in ſome <hi>diſpleaſure,</hi> and ſo loſe the <hi>honour</hi> of ſerving in the works of theſe days, the honour of being of the number of the <hi>watchers</hi> by whoſe decree (in aſſociation with the Lord the great <hi>watcher</hi> of <hi>Iſrael</hi>): that great <hi>tree</hi> is to be <hi>grub'd up,</hi> whoſe body is hewn down before.

               <p>IN much of this Chapter, our Saviour is diſcharging his diſciples and followets of worldly cares, which is a very merciful conſideration of our Lord, who as he knows that we have need of theſe things, ſo he alſo knows, how great a burden and hinderance the care of theſe things are unto us, how they do let and hinder our ſpeedy following after him: Now in order to this, he adminiſters ſeveral conſiderations ot them, to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge their cares by the ordinary providence of God towards all his creatures, even towards the very plant which he ſuffers not to want his moiſture, and the poor ſparrows, the providence of God watches over them; but after all theſe conſiderations the Lord brings a powerful one in conſideration for good and all, and that you have in the 33. <hi>verſe, fear not little flock, it is your fathers good pleaſure to give you the kingdom;</hi> if a kingdom may be ſecurity to you (againſt fears of want againſt earthly ſolicitudes.) <hi>Behold</hi> (ſays the Lord) <hi>the kingdom is given to you,</hi> and it is given by the Lord with all his heart, for that is the meaning of the phraſe, <hi>It is the fathers good pleaſure;</hi> it is as if the Lord would
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:57576:6"/>liken himſelf unto an earthly father, that has an eſtate which he would ſettle, and when he has ſetled it, O how is he ſatisfied, having ſetled it to his hearts content, ſo doth the Lord acquieſce in this ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling of the kingdom upon this little flock; he hath no regret when he reflects upon it, but is perfectly well pleaſed with his own act, this kingdom comprehends all in it, it is not ſaid <hi>a</hi> kingdom, but <hi>the</hi> kingdom.</p>
               <p>God hath many kingdoms (as I may ſay) or there are many conſiderations of this kingdom, the kingdom of grace, the providential kingdom, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Take the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom how you will in the whole extent and latitude of it, the father gives the kingdom to the little flock: I know that many content themſelves, and would have the Lords people to look after no other kingdom, but that in heaven; and I confeſs 'tis a very good portion, and when once we get thither, we ſhall never deſire to change that for any of another nature.</p>
               <p>But I tell you, that all the Saints departed are to come again with Chriſt, and enjoy his kingdom here upon earth, and therefore we muſt loſe nothing of our fathers gift; For the <hi>greatneſs of the kingdom under the whole heaven ſhall be given to this Saints of the moſt high:</hi> ſo that I ſay, take this kingdom in the utmoſt latitude of it (and in a kingdom you know thete is a fulneſs of all good whatſoever); All is the Saints, but I ſhall not ſtand upon that, but upon the ſettlement which the Lord here reveals unto them, and that account puts them upon a moſt generous diſpoſe of whatſoever they have in this world; <hi>ſell that you have, and give alms, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide your ſelves bags that wax not old, a treaſure in the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens that faileth not.</hi> It is as much, as if the Lord ſhould ſay, I would have you my diſciples in the confidence of
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:57576:6"/>this kingdom (of this great proviſion that I have made for you, and I would have you) as free as Princes, as Emperors; it was ſo in the primitive times, and we are not right, till we come into that ſpirit (when the Lord ſhall call for it) to put all into a common ſtock; there is much to be ſaid in this caſe, whether it be now practica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, as the caſe ſtands, and we in ſuch a confuſed ſlate as we are; If ſuch a thing ſhould be, people (it may be) would be willing to have a community with thoſe of their own judgment and perſwaſion and ways, this is not right, unleſs it be with all that believe, <hi>Act.</hi> 5.32.</p>
               <p>But after this, he comes to the exhortation that I read to you, <hi>Let your loins be girded about,</hi> here we have directions to the Lords diſciples, how they are to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe themſelves for this kingdom, and they are three.</p>
               <p>The firſt is, <hi>let your loins be girded about,</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2ly. <hi>Let your lights be burning.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3ly. <hi>Be ye your ſelves like unto ſervants that w<gap reason="illegible: faint" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>yt for their Lord when he will return from the wedding.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Firſt, <hi>let your loins be girded about,</hi> what is this? you know the loins are, the ſtrength of a man, the mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of which (I conceive) is this, be ſettled in the firm ſaith, and expectation of this kingdom, this is, to have the loins girded about, we do find this kingdom and the hopes of it to ſignifie ſo little to us, becauſe we are ſcarce reſolved, ſcarce throughly grounded and ſettled in our minds touching the truth of ſuch an expectation; therefore ſays he; <hi>let your loins be girded about;</hi> and you know, that if a man have cloaths upon him, and they hang looſe about him, this man is unapt for any action or buſineſs, his long trail hangs about his heels, and flutters ſo about him, that he cannot go about any work or buſineſs with any ſtrength; and therefore <hi>the loins be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:57576:7"/>girded,</hi> do in the 2d. place ſignify a mans preparing himſelf, and addreſſing himſelf ſtrenuouſly to the work and buſineſs that the Lord doth appoint unto him, that is, <hi>this girding of the loins,</hi> which in this caſe is waiting for the Lord, doing every thing as a wayter, having their eyes upon this coming: And therefore <hi>to be girt,</hi> is to be well perſwaded and reſolved to gird the promiſes about you, and to gird your hopes clofe unto your hearts, that ſo you may with confidence <hi>wayt for your Lord;</hi> and expect his coming.</p>
               <p>The ſecond is our profeſſion, <hi>our lights burning,</hi> our profeſſion is our lights and lamps by which we make forth our hope, and ſhine forth in it to others: Now when the <hi>loins are girt,</hi> this is a good help to the <hi>burning of our lamps,</hi> our profeſſion will be vigorous and lively when our hope is firm, when the loins are girt about with truth, that we do reckon upon it as a truth, that will not fail us, as a hope that will not deceive us, then I ſay the lamps will burn clearly: then we ſhall not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly make a profeſſion of this hope, but we ſhall make our hope viſible in all our walkings. The lamps of many Chriſtians burn very dimly, and the reaſon is, becauſe they waver in their hope.</p>
               <p>The third thing concerns our ſpirits, for the word here <hi>(your ſelves)</hi> imports ſomthing more then our profeſſion, or our faith, <hi>ye your ſelves,</hi> that is, your ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits, and your inward frame, your hearts, and your in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward man; <hi>your ſelves</hi> in all your affections, your ſelves in all things; <hi>like unto men that wait for their Lord when he ſhall return from the wedding;</hi> I would a little para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phraſe upon the words before I come to any obſervati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, <hi>when he ſhall return from the wedding,</hi> what is the meaning of this? doth the Lord return from the wed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:57576:7"/>when he comes? One would think it more pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per to ſay, <hi>that he comes to the wedding,</hi> then <hi>that he returns from the wedding;</hi> why, ſurely the Lord doth come to a wedding, he comes at laſt to the wedding-ſupper, when he comes to his people; but he comes alſo from the wedding, for the wedding is in heaven, but the wedding-ſupper ſhall be here on earth. Chriſt is marryed to his people in his own city (as I may ſay) and in his fathers houſe; and indeed all our flockings it is to heaven; by converſion we are brought thither by our father, and thither do we repair for all things; there the Bridegroom is: If we will be marryed to him, we muſt go thither to be marryed, the wedding is in heaven; now whether you will take it ſo, or whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther you will take it of the ſaints departed, <hi>the ſpirits of juſt men made perfect,</hi> who are with the Lord, he comes from thence, and brings theſe with him, to his poor Church here upon earth, who are in the 37th vers, called ſervants, <hi>bleſſed are thoſe ſervants.</hi> So that, in that ſence the Bride is the ſaints departed: and the Church on earth, they are the bride alſo: yet they are in the form of ſervants, as the Apoſtle ſayes: <hi>Gal.</hi> 4. <hi>The heyr, while he is a childe differs nothing from a ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant,</hi> and although Chriſt hath revealed ſonſhip unto us, yet ſtill we are ſons in the form of ſervants; there is much of the form of ſervants that ſticks upon us ſtill: but now thoſe that are departed and dead in Chriſt, they are the Bride, they have put off this habit and form of a ſervant, and ſo in that reſpect Chriſt may be ſaid to come from the wedding, the meaning is, his coming from heaven, that contains his coming from hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, that contains his coming from the wedding <hi>That when he cometh and knocketh they may open to him immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>atly;</hi>
                  <pb n="6" facs="tcp:57576:8"/>this doth acquaint us with another manner of Chriſts coming, then it may be many Chriſtians do dream of: They think of a glorious coming, a viſible glorious perſonal appearance, which ſhall ſtrike the world (as many as are enemies) with amazement and dread (I ſay, all that are enemies) and which ſhall bring a glorious charge unto all ſurviving ſaints; this com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing will not be a knocking at our doors, for Chriſt will make his own way, <hi>and every eye ſhall ſee him:</hi> but this coming here is a coming to our particulars; to every particular believer, as well as to the publick body: It is a coming in the night, a coming privately, a knock<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing at our doors, and ſuch a coming, as that thoſe that do not watch, will not be aware f, nor will not reap the benefit of it. And therefore he ſayes, that <hi>when he cometh and knocketh they may open unto him immediatly,</hi> this is a coming into us; not a coming to us only, but a coming into us. <hi>Bleſſed are thoſe ſervants whom the Lord when he cometh ſhall finde watching.</hi> Here is the fruit, here is the glorious fruit and advantage of thoſe to whom the Lord ſhall thus come, and finde them watch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; he ſhall change their condition from the condition of ſervants, and he ſhall make them to be the Bride, and <hi>ſhall gird himſelf and make them to ſit down, and come forth, and ſerve them:</hi> This is not the manner of a Lord to his ſervants, but this is the manner of our Bridegroom to his bride. And if he ſhall come in the ſecond watch, or come in the third watch, and finde them ſo, <hi>bleſsed are thoſe ſervants, Mark,</hi> 13.35. You ſhall finde there four watches mentioned, the evening, the midnight, the cock-crowing, and the morning, now there is two of theſe watches that are mentioned here; I might if I had time ſpeak to theſe four watches, and ſhew you
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:57576:8"/>how they meaſure out all the time, from our ſaviours departure to his coming again, for it is all of it a long night, while the ſun is out of the Hemiſphere, while Chriſt is abſent, it is all night, and the time is meaſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red by watches; I give you only the hint of what I un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand by it: the evening was from the time of our ſaviours aſcention until the putting forth of the man of ſin, which took in the firſt three hundred years, in which time, there was Judaiſm aboliſhed, and remo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved off the ſtage, the ſeven Churches of <hi>Aſia</hi> were diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mantled, and laſtly, Heatheniſm was thrown down, and this evening did reach unto the ſixth ſeal, and then that watch went out; then came on the midnight-watch the time of Antichriſt, the man of ſin, and this midnight watch was the longeſt watch of all the reſt; this watch laſted during all the time that that man of ſin, was rampant, (as I may ſay) for a thouſand years, during which time indeed thoſe that were de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered were thoſe that were ſealed, the ſealed ones, which you read of, in <hi>Rev.</hi> 7. They had a <hi>Song as in the night,</hi> they had a myſtical raign with Chriſt, du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring that time, but the <hi>whole world did wonder after the Beaſt,</hi> and this (I ſay) laſted for a thouſand years, till the cock-crowing, that is, till the dawning of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation, which began about the year 1300. And then began the cock-crowing watch, and this was the crow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the cock, <hi>Babilon is fallen</hi> as in <hi>Revel.</hi> 14. And from that time, has <hi>Babilon</hi> been falling and the Lord hath been conſuming the man of ſin, this is the cock-crowing, and this cock-crowing laſted from the 5th. trumpet unto the 6th Vyal, ſo long doth this watch laſt. Then ſaith the Lord, <hi>behold I come as a thief, bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed is he that watcheth,</hi> and ſo from thence the 6th Vyal
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:57576:9"/>doth begin the morning, (that is) the <hi>morning watch.</hi> And this I am perſwaded hath run forth ſeveral years amongſt us, I have told you partly my apprehenſions formerly, that <hi>Daniels</hi> 1290. days brought us to the morning watch: and that they came up (reckoning the times from <hi>Julian</hi>) about 2 or 23. years ago, ſince a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour 48. or 50. ſome difference there is about the time of <hi>Julian.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now that which I would hint by the way, is this, that our Lord and Bridegroom is not unmindful of his poor ſpouſe here on earth, but hath been making to her ever ſince his going from her, he hath been paſſing the time of his night-watches, not without a tender re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard to his dear ſpouſe he hath been coming in ſeveral ways, and we are now come to the very laſt coming of all, <hi>the laſt watch.</hi> For that which our ſaviour ſays in <hi>May.</hi> 13. <hi>ye know not in what hour the Lord comes, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in the evening,</hi> the <hi>Cock crowing,</hi> or <hi>in the morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,</hi> compared with this text here, that one of them holds forth the ſecreſy of his coming, and the other holds forth a gradual coming, that he comes gradually in all theſe times, in all theſe ſeaſons: and why ſhould not the Lord be gradually coming as the primitive glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry gradually went off, as alſo the typical glory went off from the ſanctuary of old. It firſt went up to the doors of the ſanctuary, and then to the midſt of the citty, there was three removes of that glory, and ſo anſwe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rably it was when Chriſt went to heaven, the primitive glory did not flee away preſently, all at once, but du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring the Apoſtles time (while they lived) there was a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>good meaſure of it abiding, but when they went off the ſtage, as <hi>John,</hi> who was the laſt of them, ſays, <hi>Little children, it is the laſt hour.</hi>
               </p>
               <pb n="9" facs="tcp:57576:9"/>
               <p> That glory was then going, when they went, and yet it did not all of a ſudden go, when they went as the Records of the Eccleſiaſtical Hiſtory ſhew, there was a great power of ſaith, a power of miracles con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ttnued after the Apoſtles days, but that glory was ſink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and it ſunk firſt inwardly, before it went off, in the viſible ſence of the Church, there was a decaying in their love firſt: ſo (I ſay) as this glory went off, by degrees, ſo it will return by degrees; I now come to propound one particular to you; <hi>ye your ſelves</hi> (I fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſten upon that) <hi>like unto men that wait for their Lord, when he will return from the wedding.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I have told you formerly it is part of my witneſs and teſtimony (which elſe is a poor broken thing, but I ſay it is a part of my witneſs and teſtimony, that the ſaints, are the inheritance of Chriſt, <hi>the riches of the</hi> glory of his inheritance is to be ſeen (if you will take a ſurvey and account of it) you muſt behold it in the ſaints. I have alſo delivered in this place, that it is Chriſts ſpiritual and powerful coming and appearance in the ſaints, that is the gteat object of our expectation, and that which muſt do our buſineſs for us. It is not his appearing in the clouds, it is not his coming down up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the earth, and manifeſting his glorious viſible per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, that will do our work if his ſpirit be not at work in our hearts, if he doth not come in a glorious manifeſtation of his ſpirit within us; it is that, that doth, and will quicken us now, and make us live the life of faith, and it is that that muſt quicken us at the laſt day, and raiſe our bodies out of the duſt, and make us live the life of glory.</p>
               <p>And that we may reconcile the perſonal appearance to and wlth his ſpiritual, I told you that the perſonal
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:57576:10"/>appearance of Chriſt is the glorious miniſtry, that ſhall call up the life of his ſpirit in his people that lyes bound there as in a ſleep, this is by way of preface to that which I would obſerve at this time.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ye your ſelves liko unto men, that wait for their Lord:</hi> now that which I would obſerve, is this, that the great care and concern of the Saints that live in thoſe times, that are upon Chriſts coming, ſhould be, that them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves may be prepared, that themſelves may be in all things like unto men of ſuch a hope and expectation. Our work is to have it brought home, to our ſelves (mark ye) your faith muſt be grounded upon this com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, which I underſtand by having your <hi>loins girded a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout,</hi> and your profeſſion muſt be ſhining, which (it may be) many are apt to think is concerned chiefly in their Church-adminiſtrations; but this is not all, but you are to look to your ſelves, to the frame of your hearts and ſpirits; look to your ſelves, <hi>you your ſelves.</hi> If this had not been ſomething more then your <hi>loins gir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded about, and your lights burning,</hi> it had been a kinde of tantology and repetition; therefore there is an <hi>Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phaſis</hi> to be put upon this, <hi>your ſelves,</hi> not your loins only, not your expectations only, nor only your pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion: Chriſt holds <hi>your ſelves</hi> a diſtinct intereſt from other men; well, but what are <hi>your ſelves,</hi> what are your ſpirits; you may cloath a man with the habit of a prince, yet may he be far from the ſpirit of a Prince, and from the true worth of a Prince; profeſſion is but a habit, and many men wear other mens cloathes, and appear in a ſplendour and equipage that doth not at all belong to them; look and ſee what they are within, and alas! you will find them <hi>full of rottenneſs and dead mens bones,</hi> and therefore you <hi>your ſelves</hi> look to your ſelves;
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:57576:10"/>and why ſhould men look to themſelves, but becauſe <hi>your ſelves</hi> are the great intereſt of the Lord; It is not your way, nor your profeſſion, but it is your ſpirit that is the Lords bride, and that is his Bride chamber into which he will enter, that when he knocketh you may open to him, that is the great buſineſs; your ſpirit is the Lords Bride, and the Lords Bride-chamber.</p>
               <p>Now what are we to look to, in our ſelves: why, firſt, let us look that we be in nothing unlike unto <hi>ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants</hi> that look for their Lord: I tell you there were no end, if we ſhould begin to ſhew the unlikeneſs; where do you find a likeneſs to ſuch ſervants? what unlikeli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs is there even in the Churches? Our Saviour tells us what is unlike, <hi>viz.</hi> to be overcharged with <hi>ſurfet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting and drunkenneſs, and the cares of this life,</hi> this is unlike ſuch a day, ſuch a hope, ſuch an expectation. Now what is the ſurfetting and drunkeneſs there ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken of? ſurely our Saviour (I conceive) would not ſuppoſe that ſurfetting and drunkeneſs in the letter was chargable upon profeſſors; and I wiſh that many profeſſors were not too much tainted with this, even with guſling and drinking from one Tavern to another, and from one good meeting to another: but there is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother kinde of ſurfetting and drunkeneſs, you know what the Apoſtle ſays, <hi>be not drunk with wine, wherein is exceſs, but be filled with the ſpirit:</hi> this drunkenneſs is ſet in oppoſition to the ſpirit, wine to the ſpirit. From whence I gather, that whatſoever hath the form or ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance of ſpirit, and is not ſpirit all that is cautioned in that place to be abſtained from. I remember the ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of a good man that came from a meeting (as we may be) his report was this, that they were ſo drunk he meant, not that they were drunk with wine, but
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:57576:11"/>Drink with their gifts, ſelf-ſufficiency; this is ſurfet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and drunkenneſs; and I wiſh with all my ſoul, that they that do profeſs the Lord, and thoſe that think they are on the upper ground, and have the advantage of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, that they would take heed of this ſurfetting and Dr<gap reason="illegible: blotted" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>nkenneſs of ſurfetting of their forms of their attain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments; thinking they are come to <hi>Sion,</hi> becauſe it may be they are come to the letter of a poor adminiſtration. Though alas! as it is managed amongſt many (if not moſt) at this very day, alas! it is a meer <hi>Babel,</hi> the one ſayes it is thus, and another ſayes it is thus, whereas I tell you I am not againſt any of them, I am not againſt the Baptiſt, nor againſt the congregational way that do baptize their children, the Lord doth bear them both, and he is able to make them both to ſtand; but this cry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing out, Lo here this is the way, and the others crying ont, Lo that is the way; whereas it is the right ſpirit in each, that is that will juſtify each adminiſtration: and except there be <hi>the unity of the ſpirit</hi> maintain'd <hi>in the bond of peace,</hi> I tell you our Churches are a meer <hi>Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bel,</hi> and yet there are among them that do maintain this <hi>unity:</hi> God forbid I ſhould think otherwiſe: There is a ſeed among the Churches that are of the large ſpirit, and do not ſet up themſelves over Chriſt, but ſhine forth according to the light communicated to them, therefore I lay no burden upon them.</p>
               <p>But (I ſay) this ſurfetting and drunkenneſs is oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſite to the very expectation of Chriſts coming; alas! are we ſo full now, are you ſo well, are you ſo hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py? what do you think, that <hi>the New Jeruſalem</hi> will be only ſnch a kind of thing as your Church-fellowſhip is? that it will ſet the crown upon the head of your form and your way? are you where you would be; ſo
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:57576:11"/>as that you are at reſt? you are drunk indeed if this be your ſpirit, what ſays our Saviour; <hi>do this till I come,</hi> as if he ſhould ſay, have your eye upon my coming, let this be your entertainment till my coming; but to think to do this is all, and leave out <hi>till he come,</hi> is to paſs by that which is indeed the glory of the ſentence; <hi>Do this till I come</hi> is as much as to ſay, you ſhall have better chear then this, better communion then this, <hi>when I come.</hi> Do this, but I will come and then ye ſhall be planted in the likeneſs of my reſurrection. This glory<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing therefore, and taking up our reſt in preſent attain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments is one ſort of ſurfetting and drunkenneſs, and I wiſh the Churches did not ſo much glory in their pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtors, and theſe glory ſo much in their gifts, and in their policies how they can manage affairs, this is not <hi>like men that look for their Lord, when he will return from the wedding.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>If our eyes, and our hearts were more upon Chriſt, we ſhould ſee all other glories fading, dim and pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhing; and if paſtors themſelves were thus ſpirited, they would be preaching this, <hi>we muſt decreaſe,</hi> and <hi>he muſt increaſe,</hi> and ſo cheriſh that life and light of Jeſus in their members, and not keep it under; which I doubt is too much the guilt of too many paſtors of eongregati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and in the government of their Churches, the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of Chriſt is in bonds with them.</p>
               <p>Secondly, Another unlikeneſs to <hi>men waiting for their Lord is,</hi> that, <hi>beating their fellow ſervants,</hi> this is ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what worſe then the other if he ſhall ſay, <hi>the Lord de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lays his coming, and ſhall begin to be at his fellow-ſervants,</hi> this is a rude thing indeed, this is a thing that one would wonder to finde in Chriſts family: what? <hi>beating their fellow-ſervants?</hi> this is for the poor blinde ſottiſh world
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:57576:12"/>to do. Where ſhall we faſten this beating? ſurely we cannot faſten it upon the prelatical Church, they not acknowledge us to be their fellow-ſervants, therefore we will excuſe them it is not they, It is true, the Saints have had great perſecution from them, and from thoſe that have taken their part, but this is not the beating of the fellow ſervants here ſpoken of; we ought to bleſs God for this preſent freedom, by what means ſoever we have it; if we have no law for it, it is to be the more admired, and we muſt ſay of God, he doth wonderfully, and it is marvellous indeed: but thoſe that beat their fellow-ſervants they muſt be fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low-ſervants themſelves. And truly I doubt this will come home to the Churches, they will be found the beaters of their fellow-ſervants: now by the way, take me right all aloug, when I ſpeak of the Churches I ſpeak honourably of them as Churches; I ſpeak of them, as the Lord doth in the <hi>2d.</hi> and <hi>3d.</hi> of the <hi>Revela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,</hi> where he acknowledges a found part, and a ſick part, and ſo I look upon the Churches at this day: there is a ſound part, and ſick and declining part, now this is the corrupt and ſick part, that <hi>beats their fellow ſervants.</hi> Truely it is very viſible, not only in word, but print, and I could wiſh that it were not ſo minifeſt, I would then ſtifle it, I would ſuppreſs it, but that it comes abroad ſo: And if ſome men can carry it, there ſhall be no Church in the world but the baptized Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregations: ſome of them ſay, that there is no way to entitle a man to the priviledges of Church-fellowſhip to Church-communion, except he comes in at that door of baptiſm that is the initiating-ordinance, now I can heartily allow them in their way and adminiſtration, and I think I can make it good, that the Church of
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:57576:12"/>Chriſt doth conſiſt of ſuch a variety of parts, and forms, and that the beauty of the vnity of the ſpirit doth a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſe from the great variety that is in the form, or adminiſtration; I can prove to you, if I had time I preſume from the Scripture, that there are in Chriſts body-miſtical living and dying Chriſtians: 14. <hi>Rom. whether we live, we live unto the Lord, and whether we dye, we dye unto the Lord,</hi> in which there is a great mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtery: that the dying ſhould be the living man, the dying-Chriſtian hath the better of it, and the living-Chriſtian that is ſpoken of there, is the weaker man, though he be ſaved: who is he that lives, why it is he that is ſtill under the law in a great meaſure. The law hath dominion over a man ſo long as he liveth, ſo that he is the living man, that is not yet unhorſed, that is not yet brought down into the grave of Chriſt (he is not yet brought down as the Lord will bring his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple) he lives to the letter, and to the form, and out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward adminiſtration: I ſay not, but that a man may converſe in forms and adminiſtrations, ſo that his life be about them till the times of reformation: God may train up his people under thoſe Pedagogies; but bear with me, that I call them weaklings: It is by way of condeſcention that the Lord comes to us in a ſigne, were it not better if we could act faith upon the Lord without theſe viſible repreſentations and forms, in which many have acquired thrones to themſelves, which the Lord never intended: ſignes were to be ſubſervient things, not to Lord it over his people, as thoſe do, that unchurch all other Churches, and throw them out of a part in Chriſt that come not in at their door. This is a beating of their fellow-ſervants what greater beating can there be, then to ſay, they are not the Churches of
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:57576:13"/>Chriſt, if they be not in ſuch a form, in ſuch a way, this is to be unlike <hi>thoſe that look for their Lord.</hi>

               </p>
               <p>The framing of our ſelves, the diſpoſing of our ſelves <hi>like unto men that wait for their Lord,</hi> not only your Lamps, and your loins, but <hi>your ſelves;</hi> I ſhall not repeat any thing I ſpake the laſt time, I ſhall only remember you, that I declared my ſence, that it is the laſt watch that we are in: into thoſe four watches (you know) I caſt the times from Chriſt unto his ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond coming. And the laſt watch I told you (I did con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive) began immediatly after <hi>Daniels</hi> firſt number of 1290 dayes expyred, now after that I came to ſhew what theſe words did import, <hi>you your ſelves like unto men,</hi> &amp;c. And I had only time then to reflect upon the unlikeneſs, to caution, that though it is not enough that we be not unlike (yet that is a great ſtep if we a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>void the unlikeneſs) I had not time to come to the po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitive likeneſs you may expect I ſhould now fall upon it, but I have been perſwaded in my own minde to caſt my diſcourſe at this time into another mould, and
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:57576:13"/>to ſpeak unto theſe two heads in this order.</p>
               <p>Firſt, to make ſome further evidence of the times that we are in, and that for this reaſon, becauſe it is the main argument and enforcement in the text here; It is that that is to put us upon the diſpoſing of <hi>our ſelves.</hi> The preparing <hi>our ſelves,</hi> It is that that hath a great in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence upon this preparation that is here required, and when I have ſpoke of that, then I ſhall come to the preparation, which is the ſecond thing; now in making evidence to you of this, that this is the time when this exhortation is in ſeaſon, wherein it doth eſpecially lye upon us to prepare <hi>our ſelves</hi> for the return of our Lord.</p>
               <p>I ſhall offer the evidence of this under two heads, Firſt, to ſhew you, that the time is fulfilled that was to precede the coming of our Saviour; and ſecondly, to ſhew you, that the ſignes of thoſe times have come up and preſented themſelves, and ſhewed themſelves be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore us, if we had eyes to ſee, and hearts to take no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice of it.</p>
               <p>Firſt, I ſay, I ſhall begin with that, that the time is fulfilled, you ſhall ſee what my meaning is, if you look into <hi>Mark</hi> 1.15. After <hi>John</hi> was put in priſon, our Saviour preaches, ſaying, <hi>the time is fulfilled, and the Kingdom of God is at hand;</hi> mark ye there, our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour that had ſpiritual enforcements enough to have driven home his doctrine, and inſtructions, into the minds of the people, yet he maks uſe of this argument, this enforcement, the <hi>time is fulfilled:</hi> the meaning of our Saviour is clear to be this, the times that were to precede my manifeſtation in the fleſh, they are fulfil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, he ſays not to them: Lo, I am here, the promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed <hi>Meſſias</hi> (though that was the thing they were to know) but he bears in the acknowledgment of that to
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:57576:14"/>them (he makes way for it) by this conſideration, the <hi>time is fulfilled;</hi> it is as much as if he ſhould ſay; my fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther did ſet the time, when I ſhould viſit the world it my firſt appearance, the time was ſet to a day, to an hour, that <hi>time is now fulfilled,</hi> therefore under that conſideration of the time being fulfilled; look about you, <hi>repent</hi> and <hi>believe the Goſpel,</hi> attend now, the time is come, ſays he, is not this clear therefore, that <hi>there is a time for every purpoſe under heaven?</hi> There was a time for his firſt appearance, and there is a time for his ſecond appearance. And when the time is come, men ſhould be up with their expectations, if our Saviour, that ſpiritual Doctor, that was able to convince the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits of men by ſpiritual power and evidence, if he work by this <hi>medium,</hi> and tell them of the time, we may be allowed to take the help of this conſideration; now the queſtion will be, how we ſhall prove the aſſumpti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, for the <hi>major</hi> is clear, if the time be fulfilled we are to look for his ſecond coming, that is clear, now, how ſhall we make that out? for this, the Lord help us and be with us; I deſire not to go forth in any confidence of the fleſh, we are all yet ſubject to miſtakes; how ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny have been miſtaken? if I ſhould tell you of an imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diate revelation made to me, that is not made to other Saints, you might demur upon it; I ſhall not go by that evidence, that <hi>the time is fulfilled,</hi> but only by the Scriptures, and that is by a double computation, a computation of <hi>Daniel,</hi> and the <hi>Revelations,</hi> compar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed together in <hi>Dan.</hi> 12.11. you have two numbers, which were there revealed unto <hi>Daniel.</hi> Upon his great ſolicitouſneſs and earneſt application to the Lord, after the Lord had thruſt him away (as I may ſay) and bid him be quiet, yet <hi>Daniel,</hi> humbly, putting himſelf
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:57576:14"/>forward again, the Lord doth ſo far yield unto him as to tell him the time how long it ſhould be, and from what date it ſhould begin. <hi>From the time that the daily ſacrifice ſhould be taken away, there ſhould be</hi> 1290 <hi>days,</hi> this is <hi>Daniels</hi> firſt number and computation. The com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation of the Revelations, you have in <hi>chap.</hi> 13. <hi>v.</hi> 5. <hi>And there was given unto him a mouth ſpeaking great things and blaſphemies, and power given unto him to conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue</hi> 42. <hi>months.</hi> Theſe 42. months being reſolved into dayes (as they are in <hi>Revel.</hi> 11.) contain 1260. <hi>dayes</hi> which is the time of the witneſſes <hi>prophecying in Sack<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cloth,</hi> and it is the time allotted unto the beaſt and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Gentiles, <hi>to trample under foot the holy City.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now <hi>Daniels</hi> firſt number of 1290. <hi>dayes,</hi> is more then this, it is 30. dayes more then this 1200, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore how ſhall we make theſe to ſquare, why? I ſhall briefly give you my ſenſe of it.</p>
               <p>I conceive they have one, and the ſame Period of expiration, though not one, and the ſame riſe, they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin not at the ſame time, but they end together. This number of <hi>Daniels</hi> 1290. concerned the Jews, ſhewing how long, they ſhould be trodden under foot by the ſucceſſors of that Monarchy, under whom they were at that preſent time, broken and humbled.</p>
               <p>The number begins from the time of <hi>Julian</hi> the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtate, and he ſays from that time, <hi>that the ſacrifice ſhould bè taken amay, and the abomination that was deſolate ſet up</hi> (which was the attempt that was made to reſtore <hi>Judaiſm,</hi> which after it was abrogated, was a deſola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting abomination) <hi>from that time there ſhould be</hi> 1290. <hi>dayes.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now the Apoſtle <hi>John</hi> ſhews the time of the beaſt, of the Roman beaſt (the Roman Monarchy under the
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:57576:15"/>laſt head of it, <hi>the Papacy</hi>) and he ſayes, there is but 1260. dayes allotted to it, therefore if theſe two num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers do expire together, we muſt begin the computati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the <hi>Revelations,</hi> 30 years after the time of <hi>Julian.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But happily you may ſay this is by gueſs only, I an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer, I have this ground for the beginning the compu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of the <hi>Revelations,</hi> 30. years later, then the time of <hi>Julian.</hi> For <hi>Julians</hi> time was 360. and I begin this computa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in 390. or thereabouts; I ſay it began after, becauſe that that was the time of the expiring of the Dragons cauſe; you know there are 3 enemies, the <hi>Dragon,</hi> the <hi>Beaſt,</hi> and the falſe <hi>Prophet,</hi> that do exerciſe the Church of Chriſt, till the <hi>Dragons</hi> time was out, the Beaſt did not aſcend the ſtage.</p>
               <p>Now, though the <hi>Dragon</hi> was caſt out of heaven about the time of <hi>Conſtantines</hi> coming to the Empire, in the year 310. yet he was not totally and finally vanquiſhed, ſo as to give up his cauſe, till about the year 390. or 393. (there is ſome difference in our Chronologie, but it is not conſiderable) when <hi>Theodoſius</hi> obtained that ſignal victory againſt <hi>Engenius.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now after that defeat, Heatheniſme never diſplayed banner in the field more, and then was that power re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved out of the way, which did let the appearing of Antichriſt, 2 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 2. <hi>He that letteth muſt firſt be taken out of the way:</hi> now then beginning at 390. both the computations will come up together, both <hi>Daniel,</hi> and <hi>John,</hi> and ſo they did come up together; I am very well ſatisfied in it (I ſpeak it as to my ſelf, but I impoſe it upon no other) I ſay they did (I humbly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive) come up in the year 1650. then was <hi>Daniels</hi> 1290. dayes expired, and then was the 42 months ended.</p>
               <pb n="21" facs="tcp:57576:15"/>
               <p> Now for the 45. dayes that are afterwards, they are (I believe) the time that <hi>Daniel</hi> ſpeaks of, here, in the beginning of this chapter: <hi>At that time, ſhall</hi> Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chael <hi>ſtand up, the great Prince, which ſtandeth for the children of thy people.</hi> This may ſeem ſtrange, that after <hi>Antichriſt</hi> his 42. months are expired, we ſhould have <hi>ſuch a time of trouble, as never was,</hi> but pray mark (I believe) there is a great miſtake in this: in the objecting of this trouble, or in the applying of it: As if it were the time properly of the Churches trouble, I grant that the Church ſhall have a great ſence of the trouble in common among others, nay I grant, that the enemies of Chriſt, and of his kingdom ſhall chiefly di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect their aim in all the time of that trouble againſt the Church; even, if it were poſſible, to blot out <hi>the name of</hi> Iſrael <hi>from under heaven.</hi> But the holy Ghoſt doth not object this trouble directly upon the Church, nor pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly; for this being that time when Michael <hi>ſtands up,</hi> the trouble is only accidental to the Church, for it is the time, that the Lord will deliver his people, the trouble is but the charges of the ſuit: would you be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered without ſuit? It is, as if a woman ſhould ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect to be delivered without travel; you ſhould look upon the iſſue of the trouble: obſerve how it is ſpirited, how it is intended, what is the deſigne of the trouble, the Lord is coming to judge, he is coming to take down this old ſtate of things, that he may bring in a new, this is the trouble of theſe times: It is not a trouble that is under the management of the enemy, as if they did, what they would, no, they are paſſive, they are driven by the judicial hand of God, they are bringing down <hi>their own houſe: with their own hands,</hi> as <hi>Solomon</hi> ſays, it is that trouble, under which the ſaints are called, to
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:57576:16"/>
                  <hi>lift up their heads, becauſe their redemption draweth nigh.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>A little to gird this cloſer to us, of the times being fulfilled, wherein I do expoſe my ſelf, and my judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. Let others think of it, and me, as they ſhall ſee cauſe, but (I ſay) I do verily apprehend it ſo, I would not come to you with vain viſions, were it not ſealed up to me, to my heart and ſoul, and it is not a new thing, but I have been a long time leading into it, and am more and more confirmed in it, that <hi>the time is fulfilled,</hi> and that this work, that is now in hand, it is Chriſts work, it is he, that <hi>gathers the nations,</hi> but (I ſay) to gird this un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to us, conſider this one thing.</p>
               <p>That <hi>Antichriſt</hi> is the laſt enemy, that is to infect or annoy the Church, and the only enemy that doth let or hinder the revelation of the ſon of God, or rather the ſon of man from heaven; and therefore, if we can ſhew, as I think we have ſhewed, that his time is out, then the time of Chriſt is come, which I ſhall deſire no other evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence for, then what you finde in the 2 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 2. Where the Apoſtle is ſetling the minds of believers, in thoſe days, touching the times <hi>of the man of ſin,</hi> and of the day of Chriſt, when it ſhould be, and he iſſues his diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe into this, as you may ſee in that chapter: that there was nothing that hindred, but the <hi>man of ſin,</hi> who was not yet revealed, but this myſtery muſt have it's time, it muſt have its courſe, he muſt be revealed, and then, when that <hi>man of ſin</hi> is revealed, then ſhall he be <hi>conſumed by the ſpirit of Chriſts mouth and deſtroyed by the brightneſs of his coming,</hi> and then comes the <hi>day of Chriſt?</hi> for ſo you ſee in the text, let <hi>no man deceive you, for that day ſhall not come, except there be a falling away firſt.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now, when that falling away hath had it's courſe,
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:57576:16"/>and that the <hi>man of ſin</hi> hath been revealed, then there is nothing to let, but Chriſt will come, I could pleaſe my ſelf with this ſubject. In the next place I come to the ſignes, which may be more ſuitable to you, then theſe calculations are.</p>
               <p>For theſe ſignes are thoſe, that our Saviour, accomo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dates to all capacities, he delivers them to his poor diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples, who were at that time, men of no extraordinary reach, though, when the ſpirit came upon them, they were wonderful men, otherwiſe they were no extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary men, and our Saviour gave them theſe ſignes of his coming.</p>
               <p>And I tell you now before I point you to theſe ſignes, I ſhall not point you to ſuch, as it may be you might think, but the ſignes that ſhall come upon you, you ſhall finde in <hi>Mat.</hi> 24.29. <hi>The ſun ſhall be darkned, and the moon ſhall not give her light, and the ſtarrs ſhall fall from heaven,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>And then ſhall appear the ſigne of the ſon of man in heaven,</hi> I confeſs I have read theſe Scriptures many and many a time, and have peruſed them over with the ſence of an allegory in them, a general no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the darkneſs of the times, and the like.</p>
               <p>And ſome look upon them, it may be, according to the letter, as if there ſhould be a wonderful conſternation upon theſe heavenly bodies, that ſhould make them to withhold their light. But I ſhall acquaint you, with what hath been preſented to me, and let them that are ſpiritual, judge of it.</p>
               <p>Firſt, where ſhall we begin theſe ſignes, for here our Saviour doth give them a beginning, <hi>(immediately af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the tribulation of thoſe dayes)</hi> now the queſtion is, what thoſe dayes are, that our Saviour ſpeaks of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, what the tribulation was, as the end of which,
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:57576:17"/>thoſe ſignes do commence? I know, that you can hardly avoid fixing that tribulation upon the deſtruction of lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teral <hi>Jeruſalem.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I confeſs, I would not undertake the task to carry the diſcourſe that doth antecede this 29. <hi>v.</hi> out to any other ſubject, then the deſtruction of <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> but yet, let me tell you, by comparing this with another Scripture, you ſhall finde a great help to diſcern what that <hi>tribula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> was, <hi>viz.</hi> Luk. 21.34. <hi>Jeruſalem ſhall be troden down</hi> &amp;c. <hi>untill the time of the Gentiles be fulfilled.</hi> Our Saviour ſpeaks here, and <hi>Luke</hi> doth record the very ſame diſcourſe of our Saviour, as <hi>Mathew</hi> doth, and it doth appear by comparing theſe, that our Saviour intended that deſcription, of thoſe calamitous times that was to come upon <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> to be a type, and a figure of that paſſing away of carthly <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the Gentiles.</p>
               <p>The one was a glaſs (as I may ſay) and a mirror, in which you might ſee the other, it was a type and a fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gure, and ſo our Saviour takes in both, he takes in the holy citty in the <hi>letter</hi> (which <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> was before Chriſts coming) and he takes in the holy city in the <hi>miſtery,</hi> earthly <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> among the Gentiles, which was to run the very ſame race and courſe, and to drink of the ſame cup with litteral <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> and therefore you find in <hi>Revel.</hi> 11. that very expreſſion, <hi>the holy Cit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty ſhall be troden under foot</hi> (the ſame that our Saviour ſays of <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> in the letter) till the time of <hi>Papiſme</hi> be fulfilled, that is the 4th. Beaſt under the laſt head, ſo that from ſhe expiring of thoſe times, commence theſe ſignes, and this is a good ſtep that we have gained to ſee, where to pitch the <hi>Epocha</hi> of thoſe ſignes; now as to the true import of theſe ſignes, there hath been great
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:57576:17"/>
                  <hi>darkning of the ſun, and the moon and the ſtarrs, and the powers of the heavens have been ſhaken,</hi> at the opening of the 6th. ſeal. But they have not been fulfilled, as they were here intended, thoſe ſignes were to commence from the end of the 42. <hi>months,</hi> or from <hi>Michaels ſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding up,</hi> which is all one time (as I conceive) and brings us to the <hi>morning watch,</hi> when thoſe ſignes are to have their fulfilling under <hi>Daniels</hi> ſecond number, or un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der that ſpace of 45. prophetical dayes, added to the 1290. days in the firſt number.</p>
               <p>Now then, let us conſider what theſe ſignes do im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port, firſt let me ſhew you this place, whence our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour takes theſe ſignes, which it may be you have not conſidered, for I did not of a long time, till it was pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented to me, and (I think) it is that which will hold, and will obtain your aſſent likewiſe.</p>
               <p>Our Saviour, as he did anſwer the Devil by Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and did delight to teach by Scripture, ſo he ſhews the <hi>day of the Lord</hi> and the day of his coming by Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, the place is <hi>Joel.</hi> 2.31. where you have theſe words, <hi>the ſun ſhall be turned into darkneſs, and the moon into bloud, before the great, and the terrible day of the Lord come,</hi> and ſo <hi>chap.</hi> 3.15.</p>
               <p>Here is the very Mother text from whence our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our takes theſe ſignes, he ſpeaks here according to Scripture, according to the prophets, for our Saviour in his miniſtry, ſpake by Scripture, though he was Lord of the Scriptures, as well as of the <hi>Sabbath,</hi> yet did he ſpeak by the Prophets, and by the Scriptures: to teach us to do ſo.</p>
               <p>Now you know the ſun, and the moon, and the ſtarrs (take them generally) they are the greater, and leſſer lights of the world, if you take them diſtributive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:57576:18"/>ſome look upon the ſun as the primitive light, the ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal light, the moon as repreſenting worldly things, and the light of humane affaires, to be ſignified by that, and the light of men whereby they walk in religion is expreſt by the ſun, the ſtarrs to be eminent lights, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in Church or ſtate, this is the common underſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding of theſe things, and we ſhall not diſſent from that.</p>
               <p>Now that which I would hold forth to you, in theſe ſignes is this, there is a 3 fold fulfilling of them.</p>
               <p n="1">1. There is <hi>a ſinful darkning of the Sun.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. There is <hi>a penal darkning of the Sun.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3. And what ſhall I ſay? <hi>a gracious darkning of the Sun,</hi> or a diſpenſational darkning of the Sun, and that which I would deliver to you, in the opening of theſe, is this.</p>
               <p>I have with me, the light of fulfiling going before me, for that I ſhall ſay to you, So that I ſhall tell you matter of fact, matter of hiſtory, in theſe things, theſe ſignes have had their eminent fulfilling amongſt us, and in our ſight, and yet but little notice taken thereof.</p>
               <p>Firſt, let me premiſe theſe two things, time and place, the time I have ſpoke of already, I ſhall add on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, that it is not in every time that theſe ſignes were ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable of being fulfilled, but it muſt be in, and from a time of great light, of great liberty, of great reformati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, from the begining of the performance of promiſes, and of Chriſts kingdom, that theſe ſignes muſt take ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect. For look you, it would not be otherwiſe ſaid pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly, the ſun to be darkned, that is dark before, that the ſun from it's ſhining forth in it's ſplendor and glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to be darkned, there is the ſigne; and the moon in its brightneſs to be <hi>turned into blood,</hi> there is the ſigne; and the ſtarrs from ſhewing themſelves, in the height of
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:57576:18"/>heaven to fall from heaven, there is the ſign.</p>
               <p>Now next for the place, or ſubject, in which theſe are to ſhew themſelves, that is another thing; it is not to be limited or confyned to <hi>Babylon</hi> or <hi>Rome,</hi> ſtrictly taken, for we ſhall finde that theſe expreſſions are ſpoken of <hi>Babylon</hi> and <hi>Idumea, Eſa.</hi> 34. and in other places.</p>
               <p>But I ſay, the ſubject that theſe ſigns do operate up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and the heavens in which they are to ſhew them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, they are more large, it is this old world, this old ſtate of things; take it in it's utmoſt latitude and extent, this old ſtate of things, let it be found amongſt thoſe that ſpit at <hi>Rome,</hi> and at Popery, and think ſcorn that they ſhould be in the leaſt tax with it.</p>
               <p>Having promiſed theſe 2 things, concerning time and place, that theſe ſigns ſhew themſelves at ſuch a time after a great light and reformation, and they will ſpread themſelves all over.</p>
               <p>Now I come to thoſe 3 things, the ſinful, the paenal, and the diſpenſational fulfilling of theſe ſigns, and all theſe you may conſider them, in the 3 fold orb and ſphear, I ſhall only give you, a little ſhort character of the fulfilling of theſe in each.</p>
               <p>When a people of high and raiſed principles and profeſſion ſhall degenerate and ſit down in low, vile, and baſe practiſes; This is one fulfilling of this ſigne of darkning the ſun a ſpiritual Orb and ſphear, in a ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful way, and let me tell you theſe ſignes have been up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on us, and had we been ſpiritual and acquainted with the Scripture, we might have read the doom of the po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litical and the Eccleſiaſtical ſtate of things therein. 2. The Second, the political ſphear, the darkning of the ſun there: I would expreſs thus: when thoſe that had the cauſe of God in their hands, the cauſe of religion, and
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:57576:19"/>the liberties of men, when they did deflect and turn aſide to a private intereſt, to ſeek themſelves, when they did (I ſay) ſit down in ſelf intereſt, ſelf-ſeeking, and ambition, and neglected that plough, that they had put their hands to, then was the ſun darkned in the po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litical ſphear, ſinfully, this was a ſinful darkning, a ſinful infirmity, or weakneſs in the political ſphear.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Thirdly, the Eccleſiaſtical ſphear, I will deſcribe that, thus, when thoſe that have groaned under the yoke and bondage of <hi>Antichriſt,</hi> and have found mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, and have been brought up from under deck, when they ſhall wantoniſe it, and forget the goodneſs of God, and ſhall go about <hi>to build the things that they had de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyed,</hi> and carry back the people, the flocks under their charge into <hi>Egypt</hi> again, and bring them under bondage again, this is the darkning of the ſun in the Eccleſiaſtical orbe and ſtate, this is the ſinful darkning of the heavens.</p>
               <p>And this brought on the penal darkneſs, which I think we are all ſenſible of, when God did let thoſe that had ſinfully, or through ſinful infirmity been pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailed with by temptations, to darken themſelves, and to draw ſackoloth over the ſun, the light of the appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance of God, in which they come forth, then the Lord ſuffered them by their own diviſions, and by their weak, fooliſh and heady mannagement of things to pul down their own walls, to break down their own bankes, and pull up their own hedges, and to make way for the old bondage, and the old corruptions to break in upon them, this was the Lords penal darkning of the ſun. It may not be ſo expedient for me to be particular in theſe, neither may it be needful, becauſe the ſence of every one of us can readily prompt us, and
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:57576:19"/>ſupply us, with more particular enlargements, and ſad experience can ſhew that the Lord did remove and take away, or ſuffered to be removed, and taken all the light, that did remain, inſtead thereof moſt unſavory ſnuffs do fill the candleſticks, and all places, from whence the people of God in their civil and religious things ſhould be fed, either with judgment or inſtruction. Brutiſh paſtors are come up, that feed not, that care not for the flock, a dark ſun in the firmament in the ſtead of the true ſun, and of the chearing and refreſhing light of judgment and juſtice and righteouſneſs: we might be large in theſe things, but I ſhall rather leave this to your own enlargment, in your own thoughts.</p>
               <p>Now one word of the diſpenſational darkneſs of the ſun, there is a diſpenſation of God upon us, and his diſpenſation is holy, and it doth aim at the greateſt ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantages, the greateſt good to his people, that ever any diſpenſation did travel of, or bring forth. And that, the prophets are very full of that tell us, <hi>the Sun ſhall be aſhamed, and the moon confounded, when the Lord of hoſts ſhall raign in mount Sion,</hi> Eſai. 24.</p>
               <p>Do not think that the weakneſs of men, your friends. or the malice of men your enemies, could whelm you under ſuch providences, ſuch diſappointments as theſe are, if the Lords hand had not been in it, if it were not for good, the Lord would not take away the light of the ſun, the light of our eyes from us, but that he might give us a better light, a light that ſhould be, as that <hi>of ſeven days.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And therefore in this caſe, we may reflect upon the ſwanlike ſong of <hi>John,</hi> who cloſes his eyes, and gave up to the Bridegroom with this conſolatory conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: <hi>He muſt increaſe, but I muſt decreaſe;</hi> this, he
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:57576:20"/>ſpake in the name, and perſon of his adminiſtration, and of his work: And ſo ſays the prophet, the <hi>day of the Lord</hi> (ſays <hi>Eſay</hi>) <hi>ſhall be upon every thing that is high;</hi> becauſe it is that, that will wonderfully exerciſe us, when it is, therefore the holy ghoſt enlarges upon it, that ſo you may ſee it, to be no other then what was in proſpect, in foreſight. And in that chapter there is a particular inſtancing in all thoſe glories, that ſhall be darkned and brought down before the Lord.</p>
               <p>If you ask upon what account I ſtate it? I anſwer, It is upon this old aneient conſtant account, all the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings forth of God, they have as well ſupplanted and removed that which hath been before, that is their firſt work, <hi>For fleſh, and blood cannot inherit the kingdom of God.</hi> It muſt be removed, <hi>the old bottles cannot bear the new wine,</hi> and therefore there muſt be <hi>new bottle, for the new wine,</hi> and I pray you in the taking of this in, under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand, that it is no more, nor no leſs then a firſt creati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on-glory that is removed. Let it be found where it will in Church, in ordinance, in duty, in gifts, in miniſtry, firſt creation-glory muſt all go down, that is the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon that it hath not held it.</p>
               <p>I believe, we have had in our days, as great a taſt of firſt creation-glory, and that in good men, in Saints, who (I believe) are in heaven; yet (I ſay) their work was much in a firſt creation-ſpirit, and it was too weak, it could not hold out, for <hi>the law makes nothing perfect,</hi> and I tell you there is much of the law hangs ſtill upon us in all our Church-work, yea in all our duties. I need not tell you, your duties have been ſhaken, (I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve) you have felt it, but the reaſon is, becauſe you are not <hi>holy and unblamable in love,</hi> but in fear, and in bondage; what is that, that puts you upon all you do,
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:57576:20"/>but times and ſeaſons? therefore (I ſay) ſo far there is a ſhaking, and there will be a terrible ſhaking, I will end with that Scripture in <hi>Ezek.</hi> 38.19. <hi>v. Surely in that day there ſhall be a great ſhaking in the land of</hi> Iſrael, <hi>in the land of</hi> Iſrael, <hi>ſhall be a ſhaking</hi> as I told you before, <hi>even the land of Iſrael</hi> ſhall not be exempted, though it is all for <hi>Iſrael,</hi> it is for the ſervice of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> that this ſhaking is, that ſo, <hi>that which cannot be ſhaken, may re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main;</hi> I cannot now ſhew you what work this calls for from our hands, if we be drawn from under theſe ſignes and recovered; but I tell you, there is no reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very, till the Lord appear, you will find this darkning will ſpread over all the chriſtian, and Antichriſtian world, and it will not be long, for we are upon the midle of the morning watch of <hi>Daniels</hi> laſt 45. days after the 1290. days.</p>

               <p>WHat the Apoſtle <hi>Peter</hi> ſayes of the Goſpel preached by the Prophets, that <hi>non unto them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, but unto us did they miniſter,</hi> may be ſaid of the Evangeliſts in the preſent ſubject, that we are more concern'd therein, then thoſe primitive times, and that theſe times we are now in, border very nigh upon Chriſts coming, which gives great force to the exhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation; this I have endeavoured to evince two wayes.</p>
               <p n="1">
                  <pb n="32" facs="tcp:57576:21"/> 1ſt. That the time, that was to run out before Chriſts ſecond coming, is fulfilled, namely <hi>Antichriſts</hi> time or the days of <hi>the man of ſin</hi> are expired, the beloved diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple <hi>John</hi> in his Revelation, begins his account of the 42. months, from the paſſing away of the heathen world (the heathen Empire) which, though it began to be diſſolved at <hi>Conſtantines</hi> coming to the throne (which was about the year 310.) yet was it not wholly blown off the ſtage, until about the year 390. when that fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous defeat was given to <hi>Eugenius</hi> (the general of the heathen forces) by <hi>Theodoſius</hi> the Emperor, after which time Heatheniſme never diſplayed banner in the field more.</p>
               <p>So that from that time, I begin the 42. months of the Beaſt, and ſo reckoning from that time 1260. days you know, when they came up.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The next eſſay to evidence the time, that we are now in, to be ſo nearly approaching to Chriſts com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, was by the ſignes of the times, this being firſt pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed, that from the end of the 1290. days, there is but 45. more by <hi>Daniels</hi> computation unto the reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection of the dead, or Chriſts coming, and as to the ſignes of the times, I pitcht upon <hi>Mat.</hi> 24. the <hi>turning of the ſun into darkneſs,</hi> the darkning of the ſun, and this I opened to you in a threefold ſence.</p>
               <p>The ſun may be taken, for the political, or the Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleſiaſtical ſun, and both theſe are darkned in a ſinful way by mens own apoſtacy, and declyning, and in a penal way by the Lords juſt judgments overturning of them.</p>
               <p>And in a diſpenſational way as a witnes and teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny to that better and brighter ſun, that is to ſhyne forth, and ſo I did give you ſome little brief deſcription of
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:57576:21"/>all theſe things, whereby they that are wiſe may un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand a great deal more then was then expreſt.</p>
               <p>But I ſhall ſtand no longer upon the repetition of any thing I ſpake the laſt day, but let us look forwards, I propounded to you (you know) in the next place, to come to the influence that theſe conſiderations ſhould have upon us, which I thought I ſhould be ready for, upon what I had already diſcourſed, touching the ſignes of the times. But finde, I ſhall be a little longer in making my way to it, and I hope not without profit, nor without ſome ſatisfaction to you.</p>
               <p>And I will tell you what it is that caſt me upon a little longer and further explication of the times, I was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidering, that ſignes do import a futurity, they im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port that the thing whereof they are ſignes is yet fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and to come, ſignes go before the thing, whereof they are ſignes.</p>
               <p>And truly, there may be a great deal of ſnare in this, and the fleſh may take occaſion, it may take advantage by this, to put off the day of the Lord, ſaying we are but under the ſignes of it, and who knows how long theſe ſignes may laſt, the day may be a great way off.</p>
               <p>Therefore, I now muſt bring you a little nearer un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the day of Chriſt, whereas you finde a paſſage in <hi>Daniel chap.</hi> 7. of their bringing the <hi>Son of man</hi> near unto the <hi>ancient of days</hi> (they brought him near before him) ſo there may be a bringing of us near before him, or near unto the days of the Son of man, and it will be a very good ſervice to us, if we can be ſo brought juſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and righteouſly.</p>
               <p>Now that is it, which I ſhall at this time ſpeake un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to, and I have confidence to tell you, and I think the Scripture will ſtand at my back in it, that the times of
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:57576:22"/>theſe ſignes, that I have ſpoken of are called alſo. <hi>The days of the ſon of man,</hi> ſo that there is a beginning of the coming of the ſon of man in theſe ſignes.</p>
               <p>And therefore, our Saviour ſays in <hi>lukt</hi> 21. <hi>when you ſhall ſee theſe things begin to come to paſs, then look up, and lift up your heads for the day of your redemption draw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth nigh.</hi> How nigh you will ſay? why? within a ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration, and what are theſe gnerations that our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our points at, if you look into <hi>Math.</hi> 1. And compare all thoſe times, 14.14. and 14. generations, you ſhall finde, that the latter 14. generations were not much above 40. years, one with another. And I have alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy pointed to you, the length of this generation, in which theſe ſignes, are to give Chriſt to the world, that they are but 45. years at the moſt, but I ſay, this time is called the days of the ſon of man, this you ſhall finde, <hi>Luk.</hi> 17. in ſeveral verſes from <hi>v.</hi> 21. to <hi>v.</hi> 27. <hi>The days will come wherein ye ſhall deſire to ſee one of the days of the ſon of man,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p>So that there is more then one day, there are days, one of the days, of the Son of man. ſo likewiſe in the 27. and 28. <hi>v.</hi> and ſo on, <hi>As it was in the days of</hi> Noah, <hi>ſo it ſhall be alſo in the days of the ſon of man,</hi> now mark, what I ground my ſelf upon, it is this, that as in the old world there was a matter of 120. <hi>years,</hi> wherein God was giving warning to the world, and yet all that while, the flood was coming (it was a coming all that 120. years) and ſo, as in the days of <hi>Lot</hi> (for ought I know) from the time that the captivity of <hi>Sodom</hi> was brought back by <hi>Abraham,</hi> when he prevailed againſt the 4. Kings, which was a figure of the 4. Monarchies that the true <hi>Abraham</hi> will vanquiſh. For ought I know, from that time <hi>Lot</hi> was a faithful warner and
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:57576:22"/>admoniſher of the <hi>Sodomites,</hi> for it is ſaid, that <hi>his righteous ſoul was vexed day by day</hi> (he did vex himſelf with reproving of them) and as <hi>Noah</hi> was a <hi>preacher of rigteouſneſs,</hi> ſo was <hi>Lot.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And there was ſuch days of <hi>Lot,</hi> days of witneſing and days of warning) and all that while fire was com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing upon <hi>Sodom,</hi> ſo likewiſe now there are the <hi>days of the ſon of man,</hi> that is, there is a certain lot of time wherein the ſon of man is preparing for his coming, wherein his curriers are going forth, and are giving warning of the Bridgroomes coming. The judge is co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming, his harbingers, his Heraulds they are gone forth, theſe are called the <hi>days of the ſon of man;</hi> It is true, it is not the days of the viſible perſonal appearance, that comes in the rear of all, but theſe are the days of the <hi>ſon of man</hi> that are to diſpoſe the world for his recepti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, ſome as forerunners draw others in a way of mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, that they may have a ſweet, a comfortable cloſure with the Lord, theſe I call <hi>the days of the ſon of man.</hi> They are days, wherein the ſon of man ſtands up, and is pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paring himſelf as you meet with ſuch an expreſſion in <hi>Dan.</hi> 12. <hi>At that time ſhall</hi> Michael <hi>ſtand up, the great Prince that ſtandeth for the ceildren of thy people.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And therefore theſe <hi>days of the ſon of man,</hi> they are days in which all things are working to his intereſt, &amp; towards his coming, though they be trouble ſome times, as <hi>Dan.</hi> ſays, yea <hi>ſuch as never was,</hi> yet they are ſuch times in which Chriſts intereſt is riſing, though it riſes by very ſtrange methods and ways (that ſeems even contrary) yet his intereſt is riſing, and his enemies are falling.</p>
               <p>You may remember the two characters, that I gave you the laſt day of the ſignes of the times, how they muſt be qualified, if ſo be, they be ſignes, <hi>if the trumpet
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:57576:23"/>give a certain ſound,</hi> there muſt be theſe two qualifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions in the ſignes. Firſt they muſt be in a right place, they muſt give their witneſs in a right place, and 2dly, in a right nicke of time, a right juncture; the place I told you, where theſe ſignes are to be looked for (the darkning of the Sun, and the like,) the place where theſe do give forth their voices, It muſt be in a place, that is moſt noted, moſt eminent, that is the very eye of the world or light, and purity, and reformation; there it is, that theſe ſignes muſt give forth their voices. It is not in any part of the world, it is not in <hi>Egypt,</hi> it is not in <hi>Babilon,</hi> but in <hi>Iudea,</hi> in <hi>Ieruſalem,</hi> I ſay it is, it muſt be in thoſe places, it muſt be that eminent ſun that muſt be darkned, that is, (as I may ſay) the ſun of the world, the ſun of the age, this is the ſun, that muſt be darkned.</p>
               <p>Then 2ly, it muſt be in ſuch a time too, in ſuch a juncture, when the ſun hath (as I may ſay) recovered his light, and is in the greateſt freedom, hath diſpelled and ſcattered the clouds, and miſts, and ſhins forth more clearly, it muſt be at ſuch a time, that it muſt be darkned: and I ſuppoſe, I need not apply theſe two qualifications, to ſhew you, that they may be diſcer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, upon the ſignes that we have had, that there hath been ſuch a place, and at ſuch a time too, there hath been ſuch a darkning of the ſun.</p>
               <p>Therefore now to proceed, if theſe, ſignes have gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven forth their voice among us, why? then theſe are <hi>the days of the ſon of man,</hi> the days wherein he is pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paring, wherein he is making ready for his expedition, he is <hi>bowing the heavens,</hi> as I may ſay, <hi>to come down a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt us,</hi> And the Lord grant that we may have a ſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctified uſe of theſe warnings of his, I muſt profeſs to
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:57576:23"/>you that <hi>I bave believed, and therefore have I ſpoken,</hi> I cannot get over theſe things, in my own ſpirit.</p>
               <p>I ſee ſuch Progidies, ſuch prodigious times, and perils, ſuch prodigious wickedneſſes and violence I ſee ſuch impieties of the whole world, the filthyneſs of <hi>Sodom,</hi> the daring wickedneſſes of this age, even eg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging and provoking the Lord down from heaven to judgment, as if he did not make haſt enough.</p>
               <p>I ſee (I ſay) me thinks the age putting forwards themſelves, as if the ſtage would not be cleared faſt enough for the Lord to appear, they are driven upon ſelf-deſtroying wayes and courſes by a judicial hand, theſe things are very notorious and viſible, (I ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe) to your eyes and obſervations as well as mine.</p>
               <p>Nay to expreſs it a little further, we ſee the <hi>powers of heaven ſhaken,</hi> we ſee foundations pulled up, we ſee the <hi>very earth, and the inhabitants thereof diſſolved,</hi> Merchants, and others breaking nay what do we ſpeake of them, kingdoms breaking, Churches breaking, and are you aſleep? are you not a ware that theſe are <hi>the days of the ſon of man,</hi> and which is indeed no leſs a ſigne then all the reſt, we ſee ſuch a ſleep, ſuch a lethargie upon moſt, even the wiſe as well as fooliſh virgins, nay we ſee now that <hi>night is for a viſion unto the prophets,</hi> and the <hi>ſun is gone down</hi> even <hi>at noonday,</hi> ſo that men do ask <hi>Watchman what of the night?</hi> what hour of the day is it? or <hi>what of the night?</hi> and few there are that do ſee, or take notice, that theſe <hi>are the days of the ſon of man,</hi> and that the coming of our Lord is ſo near as indeed it is.</p>
               <p>And this is as great a ſigne as any, for ſo we are told it ſhould be, <hi>who is blind as my ſervant,</hi> and <hi>who is deaf as the meſſenger I ſent, ſeeing many things,</hi> but <hi>thou ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerveſt
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:57576:24"/>them not, and hearing, but thou underſtandeſt them not.</hi> Incaſe 40, or 50. years ago, a man ſhould have laid forth that which we have ſeen with our eyes, and heard with our ears (if a man (I ſay) ſhould have laid them forth in lively colours of their own acting) you would not have ſtuck to have ſaid and concluded im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediatly, that theſe led the way to Chriſts coming.</p>
               <p>But (I ſay) that fate that is upon us of heſitancy and darkneſs, and blindneſs, that we do not underſtand the ſignes while we are under them, is of it ſelf one of the greateſt ſignes, <hi>For when he comes, ſhall he finde faith on the earth?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And <hi>Daniel</hi> hath told us, that <hi>the wiſe ſhall under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand,</hi> but the <hi>wicked ſhall not underſtand,</hi> well! let me come now to make ſome impro<gap reason="illegible: blotted" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap>ent of this, If theſe be the <hi>days of the ſon of man,</hi> we may look for the ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filling of all that is promiſed, and I tell you, that if theſe be the days of the ſon of man, limitted for the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance of all, before his perſonal appearance, there is but a little time, yet to come, and therefore I ſay we may look for theſe births to come very thick one upon another, thoſe great promiſes of the deſtruction of all Chriſts enemies, and the <hi>gathering of all his elect;</hi> b<gap reason="illegible: blotted" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap>th Jews and Gentlles, <hi>from one end of the heaven unto the other.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But, that which I deſire to ſpeake to, at this time, is a word to our ſelves, (or the Lords people) that we may be ready, if theſe be the <hi>days of the ſon of man,</hi> and that there is determined ſuch a darkning of all glory (all firſt-creation glory) and that ſuch a <hi>conſumption is decreed upon all the earth,</hi> then it concerns us to look to our ſtanding. Thoſe that have the name of Chriſt, the affaires and intereſt of Chriſt in their hands (as the
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:57576:24"/>Churches inſpecial pretend to have) It's ſaid <hi>that the moon ſhall be</hi> confounded, and <hi>the ſun aſhamtd, when the Lord of hoſts raigns in Mount Sion,</hi> therefore I ſay it concerns us.</p>
               <p>If I were now to ſpeake to the Churches, but it may be the Churches may hear what I ſay, I deſire to deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver my teſtimony without any juſt offence to the Churches,</p>
               <p>But I muſt ſpeake, and I think the Lords intereſt doth require it; it concernes the Churches to look to themſelves, and their work, and to conſider what it is they build! whether it be that which will ſtand in the day of the Lord.</p>
               <p>It is true, the Lord hath owned the Churches againſt darker forms, and I have been of the number of them that have bleſt the Lord for his owning the Churches. They have ſtood to their principles, they have kept up their meetings, and God hath been with them in this thing, but let them take heed, leaſt their table be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come a ſnare, and leaſt this ſucceſs, and owning that they have had from God, turn not to their hurt, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they have born up, againſt <hi>the day of man,</hi> let them not think they can bear up againſt the <hi>day of God,</hi> there is a day that will ſearch them, although they have ſtood the ſhock of their enemies and perſecutors.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Machabees</hi> were owned by the Lord in their days, but the ſucceſſors of thoſe <hi>Machabees</hi> (who were under the 2d temple) fell before Chriſt, though they were owned againſt the heathen. Theſe ſucceſſors were the ſcribes and Phariſees, men exceeding zealous of the law, I ſay they were the ſucceſſors of the <hi>Machabees.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>That which I am jealous of, is, that there is an inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt of man, a fleſhly, a formal intereſt, by which we
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:57576:25"/>are in danger; yea the beſt of men are in danger of Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vouring ſuch an intereſt, of eſpouſing it, of carrying it up againſt the ſpirit. For my part, I do profeſs this, that let the Churches manage their affairs in liberty, in love, and in humility, waiting for the further ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance of Jeſus Chriſt, the further breaking forth of the ſpirit, and let them keep their form till Chriſt comes from heaven for me, I ſhall never have a hand to ſtrike at them, but that which is an evil ſigne upon the Churches, is.</p>
               <p>Firſt their diviſions among themſelves.</p>
               <p>Secondly their exceeding rigid, and cenſorious car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage towards thoſe that do not jump with them.</p>
               <p>Thirdly they are every one overweening and mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifying and crying up their own form, againſt and in barr of all others.</p>
               <p>Whereas the Scripture tells us, that where the <hi>ſpirit of the Lord is, there is liberty,</hi> the ſpirit holds forth in a great latitude, <hi>him that eats, and him that eats not, him that obſerveth a day, and him that obſerveth it not,</hi> that both may do it <hi>ſo to the Lord,</hi> and both may be accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, the Lord can make both to ſtand, and the ſpirit tells us, that <hi>love</hi> is the great law of Chriſt, and that if a man <hi>have all gifts, and all knowledg, and all faith, and not charity,</hi> and that charity what is it?</p>
               <p>Why it is the <hi>holding tho unity of the ſpirit in the bond of peace,</hi> it is not in breaking that unity for any diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent apprehenſions about this, or that. I tell you, that is Chriſt, that is the great tye, and obligation of Chriſtians one to the other, and the Church of Chriſt is built up only in him, and his blood is the only cement that makes all theſe ſtones cleave together. His blood and his ſpirit are the foundation of the Church of Chriſt</p>
               <pb n="41" facs="tcp:57576:25"/>
               <p> If you ſay, that all the Churches do not ſtrike up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on this rock, I anſwert I hope ſo too, or at leaſt that there are many among all the Churches that are uncon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned herein, there is a found part that falls not foul upon Chriſt, and the ſpirit, but why do they not purge themſelves from thoſe that do, <hi>if ye do, then ſhall ye be veſſels of honour.</hi> But where is there a teſtimony born to the ſpirit? nay is there not a great jealouſly of the ſpirit, and of the prevailing of the intereſt of the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit? I tell you, thoſe that look askew on the increaſing glory of the ſpirit and of Chriſt in the ſpirit, they ſtand very dangerouſly, the day of the Lord will be heavy upon ſuch, and let my brethren of the Churches look for the converſion of the Jews, ſo do I, both of the ten tribes, and the two tribes. But let me tell you this, that the Jews will not be converted, till the vaile be <hi>taken off your hearts, and you be turned to the Lord,</hi> there is a miſtical Jew, as well as a natural Jew. And what is the miſtical Jew? you may know them in al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luſion to the natural Jew, as, as to the natural Jew, you know what the Apoſtle ſays, <hi>the Iew ſeeks after a ſigne,</hi> there was ſuch as ſought after ſignes, and ſtuck in the letter, and gloryed in outward privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges in their Temple, their ſervices and ſacrifices.</p>
               <p>So I ſay, now there are ſuch; nay, where ſhall we finde among the generality of Profeſſors any other? the Lord help us, the <hi>vail</hi> is too much <hi>upon all our hearts,</hi> and (I ſay) that induring Chriſtians are no friends, to the converſion of the Jews.</p>
               <p>We ſay alſo, that <hi>Antichriſt</hi> muſt be deſtroyed, and that he is a great let and hindrance to the converſion of the Jews; but (I ſay) that <hi>Antichriſt</hi> will not be whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly removed, untill we be more ſpiritual then we are,
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:57576:26"/>in our converſe in ordinances, and in our manageing of ſpiritual affairs. There is a great deal of <hi>Antichriſt</hi> lies lurking here, there is an old Church-ſpirit, an old teſtament-ſpirit, the ſpirit of the Jew much to be found among the Churches; now therefore, it concerns us, if we would be found helpers forward of their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion, to be more ſpiritual, for, as <hi>Antichriſt is to be deſtroyed by the brightneſs of his coming</hi> (which ſome might take for his perſonal appearance, I will not be poſitive in that).</p>
               <p>But (I ſay) there muſt be ſuch a brightneſs of his coming in his people (at the laſt) to vacat <hi>Antichriſt</hi> and diſcharge him, and (I ſay) likewiſe tha- there is a text <hi>Rom.</hi> 11.31. Which doth import, as if there ſhould be a ſignal reſtitution or reſurrection-ſpirit among the Gentile Chriſtians, before the calling of the Jews, that <hi>ſhall provoke them to jealouſy,</hi> for ſo the Apoſtle ſayes, That <hi>through you mercy, they alſo might obtain mercy,</hi> now that which I would argue from hence, is this, if the Apoſtle means only the Gentiles receiving the Goſpel, that hath been theſe 1600. years, and yet the Jews are not wrote upon, therefore I look upon this mercy here ſpoken of, to be ſome eminent mercy, that the Gentiles ſhall be partakers of, towards the end: ſome eminent mercy that ſhall be ſhewed unto them, to make them ſhak themſelves from their duſt, to ariſe, and ſhine, and this ſhall be a provocation un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Jews, when they ſhall ſee their Meſſias in the armes of the Gentiles.</p>
               <p>I tell you, my brethren, it may be, I ſpeake it rude<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, but yet I ſpeake as if I were to appear before the Lord immediatly, that I fear the preſent poſture of the ſaints, and of the Churches, and the managing of their
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:57576:26"/>affairs, is not to the ſervice of Chriſt, nor the ſervice of the Jews; nor the promoting of thoſe great deſigns of God, which he hath revealed to us, in his word, but we tread in the ſame ſteps of thoſe that are gon be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore us, as it is ſaid in <hi>Eph.</hi> 3.6.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>I have cut off the nations, their towers are deſolate,</hi> hearken ye my brethren, hath not God cut off the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, the national Churches before the eyes of the Churches, we have ſeen it, in our days, we have ſeen the <hi>ſun turned into darkneſs, and the moon in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to blood.</hi> National Churches cut off, the <hi>Towers faln,</hi> this ſhould have been for inſtruction of thoſe that came up in the room of them (in the room of rhoſe national Churches) do you think (I pray do but conſider) they were cut off, becauſe they were wicked, why? are you come paſt corruption, was there not a beauty up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on them in their day? what have ſome ſaid to me late<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly why? all the Martyrs were of our religion, ſay they, It is true there was a virgin ſpirit in that degree of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation, in it's firſt coming forth, and there was a freſhneſs upon it, but it quickly corrupted, now may not the ſame corruption grow up in others, in other forms, and if it be ſo, is God any reſpecter of perſons</p>
               <p>I wonder, that men ſhould be offended at thoſe that ſpeake what they ſee, when we ſee the ſignes upon us, muſt we not acknowledge it, thoſe that are offended with their brethren, becauſe they cannot build them up, nor ſay a confederacy with them, if they were humble Chriſtians, they would conſider and enquire, and ſay, is there not a cauſe? Is there not a cauſe why ſome walk at a diſtance? why they dare not touch with us? Why truely? if you ask what cauſe, <hi>I</hi> will tell you what cauſe, you ſay, why will ye not come among
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:57576:27"/>into the <hi>Sion</hi> of God, <hi>I</hi> tell you that is enough to turn ones ſtomack, you make as if you were come to your reſt, you are <hi>haughty becauſe of Gods holy mountain,</hi> Zeph. 3.11. <hi>thou ſhalt no more be haughty,</hi> this intimates, they were haughty before, and <hi>I</hi> tell you that is cauſe enough to ſet Chriſt and his ſpirit at a diſtance from men, when they are haughty, haughty becauſe of the Lords holy mountain, and alas! what is the Lords mountain? if the Lord be not in the holy mountain.</p>
               <p>Tis true Chriſt calls <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> to the laſt the <hi>holy ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,</hi> when it was a moſt abominable place, and the tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple his <hi>houſe,</hi> but Chriſt calls it in another place <hi>your houſe,</hi> it was my houſe indeed, but now it is your houſe, you have made it your own, you have fill'd it with your own ſpirit, and therefore it is your own now <hi>I</hi> ſhall come off from this theam, and <hi>I</hi> ſhall conclude with a little further evidence, that this is an extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary day that we are in, <hi>they are the days of the ſon of man,</hi> wherein the ſon of man muſt have his time; things muſt be managed to his intereſt, and according to his will, the man of ſin hath had his day, and his time.</p>
               <p>Now becauſe <hi>I</hi> would reliſh your mouth with this, at the cloſe, <hi>I</hi> will give you my evidence to this, that the <hi>man of ſin,</hi> hath had his time, he hath had his day, then what ſhould hinder but that the <hi>ſon of man</hi> ſhould have his day, now that the <hi>man of ſin</hi> hath had his day, I tell you, either he muſt have more time, then God hath allotted him, or elſe his time, is out for the Lord hath allotted him but 42 months. All the buſineſs is, where to begin theſe months, now (<hi>I</hi> ſay) either we muſt begin them, at the going off of the old dragon, which was the enemy that did infeſt the Church before
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:57576:27"/>the riſing of the beaſt, or elſe we muſt leave ſo much time from the expyring of th Dragon to the riſing of the beaſt, without any aſſignation of it, whereby ſo much time muſt run out, in waft, and for nothing.</p>
               <p>Now that were to reflect on Chriſt, and upon the ſpirit, either that the Lord ſhould looſe ſo much time and let it run out in waft, or that he ſhould not give us an account of that time, when he undertook that work, not to acquaint us with all the times of the Church, and all the occurrences thereof: it were to impute inſince<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity to Chriſt, which were blaſphemy to think.</p>
               <p>Whereas he tells his people, <hi>the man of ſin</hi> hath but 42. months, and then ſhall he down, mean time I will come in with faith, and patience to you, that ſo you ſhall weather the point: ſome would not begin the 42. months till <hi>Boniface</hi> the 8th. when <hi>Phocus</hi> mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered his maſter, and was ſet up in his room; but by that account, there ſhould be 200. years, that would have no name, whereas it is clear, that the beaſt was in being, and in working 200. years before, and did give manifeſt proofs of his being up, that he might be known what creature he was.</p>
               <p>And therefore I know not what authority any have to contradict, when the ſpirit ſays, it is but 42. months for them to ſay, they are not to begin, till the Beaſt was in his full height, when the ſpirit hath not ſaid ſo.</p>
               <p>Therefore (I ſay) the time of the Beaſt is expired, and all that we find of the beaſt now (which is exceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing much of his rage) they are but the effects of his wounds, he is dying, and would ſave himſelf, but (i ſay) this day is Chriſts day, <hi>Michaels</hi> day and the Lord is <hi>going on conquering and to conquer.</hi> And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it concerns the Saints to reflect upon theſe things,
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:57576:28"/>for the upholding of them, that ſo they may not faint, look for breakings, and deſolations more and more; but let your eyes be upon the deſigne, that the Lord hath in all theſe, come and behold the deſolations, that he hath made in the earth, it is all upon the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of his own intereſt and his dear ſpouſe; and therefore let us open our hearts to theſe days of <hi>the ſon of man.</hi> And ſay to the Lord, whatever ts not conſiſtant with thy intereſt, O take it from the midſt of my bow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>els, be can did, be ſincere, have no intereſt in your eye but Chriſts, he muſt have his will now, oh! comply with him, and it will be your own caſe, ſay as <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phiboſheth</hi> ſaid, <hi>let him take all, for as much as my Lord the king is come again in peace; unto his own houſe? Sam.</hi> 19.20. Oh that the Lord would bow the hearts of the Churches, of officers and members, that they might carry on no intereſt but Chriſts, I would you were all in fellowſhip, but I would have it in the ſpirit, do not ſhut out the ſpirit, nor draw a veil, nor a curtain before the ſpiritual glory of Chriſt.</p>
               <p>Theſe days of the ſon of man, as they import great things to the publike. ſo they import ſpiritual advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage to every particular ſaint, for in theſe days a ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler diſcovery of Chriſt is to be expected, and ſome have experienced it, Chriſt hath been manifeſted much in my time, comparing the diſcoveries of Chriſt with former times, with an age before, what a difference you will find, and yet they were holy perſons, and accepted then, but what high diſcoveries are there now? this place was attended with one that had not only the tongue of an Angel, but his diſcoveries was as ſublime, as his language, his ſpirit was in the car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rying up of Chriſts intereſt, that was the eye of his
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:57576:28"/>miniſtry I would not glory in men, but it is meet to be acknowledged unto God, that it hath been an age of light, and reckon upon it, that whatſoever ſtands in the way of the intereſt of the Lord Jeſus, of his ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual and powerful diſcoveries and manifeſtations, it will down, let it be Church, or ordinances, or what it will, down it muſt go, therefore let us take heed of ſetting our ſhoulders, to uphold the intereſt of any thing that is obnoxious to that of our Lord Jeſus.</p>

               <p>I Am very ſenſible, that <hi>I</hi> have not finiſhed my former text, there is a great deal yet to be ſpoken to, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on it; and therefore, <hi>I</hi> muſt make a little apology for changing my text at this time.</p>
               <p>But though <hi>I</hi> change my text and remove a little farther into this Goſpel of <hi>Luke,</hi> yet I do not change my ſubject, I ſhall ſpeake to the ſame ſubject, that I was upon before; but you may remember the laſt time, that I ſpake here, it was under great infirmity, for I confeſs, I have a very ſlippery memory.</p>
               <p>And I did not deliever much of that, I thought to have ſpoken then, by way of evidence of that truth, that I was deſirous to carry upon my diſcourſe at that time: and therefore (I ſay) becauſe I did engage on ſuch an aſſertion, as might ſeem ſomwhat ſtrange, name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:57576:29"/>that theſe days which we are in, are the <hi>days of the ſon of man;</hi> therefore I chuſe theſe words to make forth further evidence of it to you, but thoſe that were here may bear me record a little, what it was that lead me to that confidence, to aſſert, that theſe are the <hi>days of the ſon of man,</hi> you know, I was upon the ſignes of Chriſt's coming, which I had opened to you the day before (thoſe ſignes ſpoken of in <hi>Math.</hi> 24.) of the <hi>Suns being turned into darkneſs,</hi> and the <hi>Moon into blood,</hi> and applyed them to theſe times, now thoſe ſignes you will ſee are ſo contiguous, that I may ſay, they are <hi>the ſignes of the ſon of man</hi> there mentioned, and that there is but a very little diſtance, between thoſe ſignes appearing, and the ſon of mans coming and indeed, it may be a queſtion, whether that theſe ſignes are not the ſigne <hi>of the ſon of man in heaven?</hi> for it is ſaid in <hi>Math.</hi> 24.30. <hi>Then ſhall appear the ſigne of the ſon of man, immediatly after the tribulation of thoſe days</hi> now theſe words here muſt be underſtood, either that theſe ſignes are the <hi>ſigne of the ſon of man in heaven,</hi> or elſe that the <hi>ſigne of the ſon of man in heaven,</hi> is connected with theſe ſignes, and follows theſe ſignes: for (then) <hi>ſhall appear the ſigne of the ſon of man in heaven,</hi> not af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, but then, this was one thing, that lead to it. And then another thing was, that the times <hi>of the man of ſin</hi> were out, I told you: and therefore the <hi>times of the ſon of man,</hi> muſt needs be begun, of courſe, for there is no chaſm between theſe ſcenes, but like linkes of a chain, the one takes hold of the other, and before the other is quite done, the following ſcene begins, as it is ſaid of the four Monarchies (and it is, and hath been accordingly fulfilled) that the ſucceeding Monarchy in all the four, did tread upon the heels of the former,
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:57576:29"/>ſo is it ſaid of Chriſts kingdom, <hi>that in the days of theſe kingdoms ſhall the God of heaven ſet up a kingdom.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Chriſts intereſt doth commence before the total, (be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the very final and conſummate) abolition of the former intereſt,</p>
               <p>Now (I ſay) notwithſtanding this evidence that hath been offered, feeling in my ſelf, as I do, I confeſs, that this is ſomewhat a ſtrange, and a boly aſſertion, to aſſert theſe, to be <hi>the days of the ſon of man,</hi> therefore, I deſire, as well for the acquitting of my ſelf, as for the ſatisfaction of you, to give you a further account of my grounds, why I call theſe <hi>the days of the ſon of man;</hi> therefore have I thoſe theſe words.</p>

                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of this truth to you, that <hi>theſe are the days of the ſon of man.</hi> Now that which is to be expounder is firſt, why our Saviour is here called the <hi>(ſon of man),</hi> and 2ly, why the time of his revelation is not called (a day but <hi>days</hi>) and then to ſhew you (what there is in theſe days) that makes them to be called <hi>the days of the ſon of man.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Firſt, you may think, that this is an improper ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pellation of Chriſt, to call him, <hi>the ſon of man,</hi> when he is ſetting up his kingdom, but to tell you the em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phaſis of the word, it is the ſon of <hi>Enoſh;</hi> now this ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pellation is taken out of <hi>Daniel,</hi> as all interpreters do agree, <hi>viz. Dan.</hi> 7. Where he hath the viſion of the kingdom of Chriſt, ſucceeding in the rear of the four
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:57576:30"/>Monarchies, there, Chriſt is exhibited to us under the appelation of the <hi>ſon of man,</hi> or the <hi>ſon of Enoſh,</hi> which is <hi>ſorry man;</hi> now it may be thought that this notion is ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry diſagreeing to Chriſts kingdom when he comes to be <hi>great to the ends of the earth?</hi> but if you look into the 5. of the <hi>Revelations,</hi> you will ſee there, that the elders do reflect upon Chriſt, in that honour, that was put upon him, to open the book, as a <hi>lamb that had been ſlain Rev.</hi> 5.6. And you read there alſo, the Angels joyning with them in this quire, and in this very note, as you may ſee in the 12th. <hi>vers,</hi> ſaying with a loud voice, <hi>worthy is the lamb, that was ſlain to receive honour<gap reason="illegible: blotted" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> and glory, and bleſſing:</hi> So that here we ſee, that it is not caſual, that Chriſt is called the <hi>ſon of man,</hi> when he is to take his kingdom, but it is upon deſigne, it is to reflect honour upon him, upon that very account, becauſe he ſtooped and condeſcended ſo to be the <hi>ſon of man,</hi> and <hi>humbled</hi> and <hi>abaſed himſelf,</hi> as you will finde 2. <hi>Phil.</hi> 6.7. He makes the very deduction of his glory and honour, to riſe from his humiliation, <hi>wherefore God hath highly ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alted him:</hi> and this conſideration is that which doth likewiſe redound to the comfort of the miſtical body and members of Chriſt, who how low ſoever they are yet the kingdom is deſigned for them, as Chriſt ſaid to to his diſciples <hi>Luk.</hi> 12. <hi>fear not little flock,</hi> who are not only little in reſpect of number, but little alſo in reſpect of ſtature (as I may ſay) little in the account of the world, and in their own ſence likewiſe, <hi>it is</hi> your <hi>fathers good pleaſure to give you the kingdome.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Secondly, the next thing is the <hi>days of the ſon of man,</hi> it is not the <hi>day of the ſon of man</hi> but the <hi>days</hi> in the plu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral number, and this holds forth to us, that there will be <hi>days,</hi> that is, there will be a tract of time, wherein
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:57576:30"/>the intereſt of Chriſt, the intereſt of his kingdom ſhall be ſolicited and agitated in order to his glorious and publick coronation, and enthronement, <hi>the days of the ſon of man,</hi> you meet with it twice here in this chap. <hi>v.</hi> 22. And he ſaid unto the diſciples, <hi>the days will come, when you ſhall deſire to ſee one of the days of the ſon of man and ye ſhall not ſee it,</hi> that is, as it appears to me, they ſhall be looking for theſe days in thoſe fleſhly, and carnal aſſumptions (as I may call them) of ſeveral ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits that ſhall ſtart up, crying <hi>lo here,</hi> and <hi>lo there,</hi> but they ſhall ſee nothing of the ſon of man in all thoſe voices.</p>
               <p>You ſhall <hi>deſire to ſee them,</hi> and go forth, as many ſhall do, but ſhall finde themſelves miſtaken, <hi>for the days of the ſon of man</hi> are of a more general import and influence, and they are of a ſpiritual diſcerning, there is the firſt time that you meet with <hi>days,</hi> And the 2d is in my text, you have 3 times in this chapter the word <hi>day</hi> in the ſingular number ſpoken of.</p>
               <p>So <hi>ſhall it be in that day,</hi> when the <hi>ſon of man</hi> is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed, and ſo ſhall the <hi>ſon of man</hi> be in his day, now if <hi>days,</hi> in the plural number, and <hi>day,</hi> in the ſingular number be not the ſame, then they are thus to be diſtinguiſhed. The days are that tract of time, that lead to Chriſts giorious and viſible appearance, I ſhall ſtand no longer upon this, becauſe it will be more ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly made forth, when we come to ſhew the import of theſe days, what theſe days do import, what they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain in them, which I do therefore immediatly addreſs my ſelf unto.</p>
               <p>I have already ſhewed you, that they do import this, that the <hi>days of the man of ſin</hi> are ended, the days of <hi>Antithriſt</hi> are over, that is, his 42 months ſpoken of,
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:57576:31"/>in <hi>Revel.</hi> 13. I ſhall repeat nothing that I have ſaid con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning that, but only this, that the holy Ghoſt doth not ſpeak ſo improperly, as to call thoſe the <hi>days of the ſon of man,</hi> which are the <hi>days of the man of ſin,</hi> there is therefore a legall determining of the right of the <hi>man of ſin,</hi> though he may be actually troubleſom for a while after, even till Chriſts glorious appearing, and ſo there is a legal commencement of Chriſts time, though we ſee not yet all things in his poſſeſſion, yet he may have a legal right, and ſo he hath in theſe days, to which I add, that as <hi>Jacob took hold of the heel of Eſau,</hi> ſo doth Chriſts kingdom take hold (as I may ſay) of the times of <hi>Antichriſt,</hi> I ſhall not give more authority to the <hi>Apocripha</hi> then what may ſeem fitting Let it ſtand or fall to that evidence of truth, that ſhines in it, but in <hi>Eſdras</hi> you have ſuch a queſtion as this propounded by him, who holds forth himſelf to be <hi>Eſra.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>There is a queſtion held forth, touching <hi>the part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of times,</hi> he deſires to know of the Angel, what is the <hi>parting of time</hi> between the two worlds, and he receives this anſwer, that <hi>Eſau</hi> is a figure of the <hi>old world,</hi> and <hi>Jacob of the new,</hi> and ſays he, look as there is the hand of a man, between the hand and the heel, ſo there is no more time, between the old and the new.</p>
               <p>Now I can make no ſence of that anſwer, but this that as there was no hand at all between the hand and the heel, that is, the hand of <hi>Jacob,</hi> the power of the new world, that took hold of the very heel of the old world and thruſt it out; ſo doth the power of the ſon of man and his days (the very begining and commence<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of his kingdom) thruſt out the <hi>old world.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And let me obſerve this, by the way, that this king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom,
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:57576:31"/>and theſe <hi>days of the ſon of man,</hi> if they did take place in our ſpirits, and in our faith, we might be ſo much the more ſerviceable in thruſting forth the old ſtate of things: Therefore, now I ſhall come to ſhew what makes them to be called <hi>the days of the ſon of man,</hi> for if you ſee <hi>Antichriſt</hi> the <hi>man of ſin</hi> ſtill upon the ſtage, you will ſay, upon what authority do you lay Chriſts claim to theſe days? what ground have you for it? how are theſe his days more then any other?</p>
               <p>Let me tell you, my beloved friends, theſe <hi>days</hi> are not only the <hi>days of the ſon of man,</hi> becauſe they are not the <hi>days of the man of ſin</hi> (as <hi>wafts</hi> and <hi>ſtraies</hi> belong to the Lord of the Mannor, it is not only for that reaſon I call them <hi>the days of the ſon of man</hi>), but Chriſt hath a legal right unto them, and his term be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gins in theſe days.</p>
               <p>You may ſay, we have always been otherwiſe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructed, it is a common received thing, that Chriſt's kingdom begins with his viſible appearing, and that 2 <hi>Timo.</hi> 4.18. <hi>v.</hi> ſeems to countenance this, which runs thus, <hi>I charge thee before God, and our Lord Jeſus Chriſt who ſhall judge the quick and the dead, at his ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearing and his kingdom,</hi> where, his appearing may be conceived to commence with his kingdom, and his kingdom not to commence or begin, till his glorious and perſonal appearing.</p>
               <p>To this I ſhall anſwer: it is true, that text doth ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſarily import, that Chriſt muſt appear in his king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom. And that I do verily believe, and do expect; but that Chriſts day, or Chriſts kingdom hath no be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning, till there be an Adequate revelation of his perſon, untill he appear as a man, in that kingdom, as well as God, cannot, that I ſee, be thence infer'd.</p>
               <pb n="54" facs="tcp:57576:32"/>
               <p> For we ſhall ſhew you by and by, by the types that were held forth, and the times of the old teſtament that there may be a beginning of Chriſts kingdom (and is ſo) before his glorious appearance, and manifeſtation, and there may be many kingdom-Acts done before Chriſt in perſon do exhibit himſelf viſible to our eyes; that which I would begin with, you ſhall finde in <hi>Dan.</hi> 12.1. <hi>At that time ſhall</hi> Michael <hi>ſtand up.</hi> This is the firſt thing, in <hi>the days of the ſon of man,</hi> Michaels <hi>ſtanding up,</hi> for I look upon the action, which is ſhewed unto <hi>Daniel</hi> here (for the conſuming and bringing to nought the four Monarchies: both in the Eaſt, and in the Weſt) to fall into theſe days of the ſon of man, and to be performed by Chriſt, who is the <hi>Michael</hi> here <hi>that ſtands up.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now I confeſs there may be ſome queſtion whether this <hi>Michael</hi> be Chriſt, or no? becauſe we read of <hi>Michael</hi> (in this prophecy of <hi>Daniel</hi>) that is ſpoken of, as one of the chief princes, one of the chief Angels, which is not proper to be applyed to Chriſt.</p>
               <p>For he that is the ſupream, is not in a rank with the Angels, nor conſigned to a particular charge or pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince, as he is called <hi>Michael your prince,</hi> in the 10 <hi>chap.</hi> and the laſt <hi>verſe.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now if it be but the ſtanding up of <hi>Michael the Archangel,</hi> there is ſomething to be done, when <hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chael</hi> ſtands up (and it being a word which is both paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive and mean too.) It ſignifies <hi>to be raiſed, or rouſed up,</hi> as if before this time, he did couch or lye down, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore if we take it of <hi>Michael</hi> the <hi>Archangel,</hi> it im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ports ſomthing, but I have two or three reaſons why I take it for Chriſt.</p>
               <p>Firſt, becauſe he is mentioned ſingly, <hi>then, at that time ſhall</hi> Michael <hi>ſtand up.</hi>
               </p>
               <pb n="55" facs="tcp:57576:32"/>
               <p> For though a ſingle Angel may be ſent to carry ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dings unto the Saints, yet a ſingle angel is not compe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent to have the whole affairs of Chriſts intereſt, and his kingdom committed to him, and to ſtand up ſingly for it, this is a work rather for the Lord himſelf, this is one reaſon: Another reaſon, is this, becauſe it is ſaid, at <hi>that time ſhall</hi> Michael <hi>ſtand up, the great prince,</hi> but in the <hi>Septuagint,</hi> and ſo likewiſe in the <hi>Hebrew,</hi> there are two Articles; in the Septuagint, it is <hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chael the prince, the great,</hi> now I ſay, theſe are not pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per for an angel, theſe are ſovereign titles, and belong to the Lord himſelf. As we uſe to ſay <hi>Conſtantine</hi> the <hi>great,</hi> and <hi>Theodoſius</hi> the <hi>great,</hi> they are all ſovereign attributes, that is a ſecond reaſon.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, <hi>at that time ſhall</hi> Michael <hi>ſtand up, the great prince,</hi> we never read of Gods ſending any creature, either Angel, or man to be a ſingle Champion and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liverer of his people, but we read oftentimes, that God engages himſelf ſingly to ariſe, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 12.5. for <hi>the oppreſſion of the poor</hi> for <hi>the ſighing of the needy, will I ariſe, ſaith the Lord,</hi> &amp;c. And ſo in <hi>Eſay.</hi> 23.10. and in <hi>Eſay.</hi> 42.19. and <hi>Eſay.</hi> 63.5. and ſeveral other places, where you may reade of Chriſts engaging a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone, and ſo I ſay, here it ſuits with Chriſts ſtanding up, but it ſuits not with any creature: Now then what is there in this of Chriſts <hi>ſtanding up,</hi> who is the <hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chael</hi> here (and if any ſhall yet be unſatisfied that he is called <hi>Michael,</hi> we may as well ask, why he is cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led <hi>David, David your prince.</hi>)</p>
               <p>But (I ſay) ſtanding up here, doth import a change of poſture, and an addreſſing of himſelf to the Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es buſineſs, <hi>why ſleepeſt thou?</hi> it is that which is inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mated, that the Lord in ſome diſpenſations ſeems to
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:57576:33"/>be aſleep, and let things go as they will, but when the Lord ſtands up, and awakens, it makes a great change, a great alteration, when Chriſt <hi>laid aſide his garments</hi> it was to do a ſingular thing, it was to do, or ſhew a ſingular, a wonderful act of condſcention and grace.</p>
               <p>And ſo when Chriſt riſes up, it is the fall of his ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, and for the relieving of his ſpouſe, 'tis a riſing up with anger and indignation, with a concern, as the Lord ſays, <hi>what have I here, that my people are ſold for nought?</hi> I cannot bear it longer, then up he gets, it is ſaid, at Chriſts firſt coming, <hi>it is for the riſing and fall of many.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>What then will his ſecond coming be? when he riſes to judgment, when he riſes to pleade the cauſe of his people, well; but in the next place <hi>Michaels</hi> ſtanding up, or Chriſts ſtanding up, is a ſtanding up for him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, and for his people to <hi>take his great power, as</hi> it is ſaid in the <hi>Revelations, thou haſt taken to thy ſelf thy great power,</hi> now ſhall Chriſt ſtand alone? conſider this, if a king ſtands up, and hath great occaſion to ſtand up, either that he is invaded or that his ſubject rebels againſt him, upon ſuch occaſion, his confederates and allies, will pour in their forces upon his enemies.</p>
               <p>Surely our Lord Jeſus, hath great Allies, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>federates, his father, and all his holy Angels, you know, it is Gods covenant with him, <hi>that he will give him the heathen for his inheritance, and he that will put all his enemies under his feet,</hi> before ever he hath his kingdom, we find <hi>the ancient of days upon his throne,</hi> and it is a <hi>fiery throne</hi> too, as you have it, in <hi>Dan.</hi> 7. Now if <hi>Michael ſtand up,</hi> all heaven, all the hoſts of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven will ſtand up with him, it will be found ſo, and let the Saints reckon upon it, Chriſt will not want pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er,
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:57576:33"/>this is from <hi>Michaels</hi> ſtanding up, that is the firſt thing. But then 2ly. we find in <hi>Dan.</hi> 7. another ſtrange thing which we reade, but paſs over, not knowing well what to make of it, we have done ſo many times; in the 13. <hi>v. I ſaw in the night viſions, and behold one like the ſon of man come to the ancient of days,</hi> and they brought him near before him, not to exerciſe you with the difficulty of the underſtanding of this, I ſhall im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately point you to what I think was the type of this, and will give us a very good account of it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Solomon,</hi> you know, was a type of Chriſts king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom in the tranquility and peaceable time of it, when it had wethered the point of all oppoſition, and had now got the day of all its oppoſers, now you ſhall find ſuch a thing as this in that type, before <hi>Davids</hi> days were out, <hi>Solomon</hi> was preſented to him, for the kingdom, and that by <hi>Davids</hi> allowance, and <hi>David</hi> did as it were put his power upon <hi>Solomon,</hi> and ſet him up, which gives us the cleareſt light into this prophecy, that I know of.</p>
               <p>When <hi>David</hi> was old, and cold, that they could not keep heat in him, but they were ſain to provide o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe to refreſh his blood, and to put ſpirit in him, then was thought a time for <hi>Adonijah</hi> to ſet up for himſelf, and get the kingdom, for <hi>David</hi> was like a candle in the ſocket, and ſo <hi>Adonijah</hi> might think the action would not be miſinterpreted by <hi>David,</hi> then they called all the kings Sons to the feaſt, only they left out <hi>Solomon</hi> (the true intereſt, the heir deſigned by God, and ſworn by <hi>David,</hi> he is left out) and <hi>Zadoch,</hi> and <hi>Benajah,</hi> theſe were not called, but all the reſt: now when <hi>Adonijah</hi> was at his feaſt, <hi>Nathan</hi> hears of it, and acquaints <hi>Bathſheba</hi> the mother of <hi>Solomon,</hi>
                  <pb n="58" facs="tcp:57576:34"/>who goes forthwith to <hi>David</hi> about it.</p>
               <p>Here is now in type, the bringing <hi>the ſon of man to the ancient of days,</hi> as ſhe brought <hi>Solomon</hi> ſhe is a type of the Church preſenting Chriſt unto God, ſaying, <hi>haſt thou not ſworn, that</hi> Solomon <hi>thy ſon ſhall raign after thee?</hi> This is preſenting the <hi>ſon of man</hi> to the <hi>ancient of days</hi> in the type, now ſo it is in the Antitype, ſo it is in theſe days of the ſon of man, <hi>behold King</hi> Solomon <hi>with the Crown, wherewith his mother crowned him.</hi> Can. 3. the Lords Prophets, and ſuch as are true to the Lords intereſt, bring the <hi>ſon of man</hi> to the Anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent of days, the prayers of the Saints will run much in this ſtrain, and they will be ſpeaking good of Chriſt, in the ears of God, and will be telling what their ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectations are, and how they tender the ſetting up of Chriſt, and how they ſuffer, and muſt ſuffer till Chriſt raignes, and that they never expect to ſee good days till he comes, this anſwers the type, the bringing of the <hi>ſon of man to the ancient of days.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The ancient of days is commonly looked upon to be the father, now 'tis true, the father hath covenanted and engaged to ſet Chriſt upon his throne, and he calls him his King, but you will find in <hi>Revel.</hi> 1. this very deſcription, that is in <hi>Daniel</hi> applyed to Chriſt, <hi>The hair of his head is ſaid to be as white as ſnow,</hi> and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore how ſhall we underſtand this? I will tell you how it may be reconciled by <hi>Davids</hi> Lord, <hi>Davids</hi> ſon, that is, <hi>the head of Chriſt is God,</hi> this is the head here ſpoken of, <hi>(the hair of his head was as white as wool:)</hi> and therefore I ſay, this preſenting the ſon of man to the ancient of days, is but the bringing the right heir, Chriſt <hi>the ſon of man,</hi> to the head of Chriſt, which is God.</p>
               <pb n="59" facs="tcp:57576:34"/>
               <p> In the next place, there is not only the preſenting of <hi>Solomon</hi> (as a type) unto <hi>David,</hi> but <hi>David</hi> doth appoint <hi>Nathan</hi> to go and anoint <hi>Solomon</hi> and ſet the crown upon his head, and ſends <hi>Benajah,</hi> and <hi>Zadock</hi> with him.</p>
               <p>So this is, in theſe days of the ſon of man, there is an anointing of Chriſt, and an inſtructing of him (as I may ſay) as <hi>David</hi> did inſtruct <hi>Solomon</hi> his ſon, and as in the Pſalmiſt, it is ſaid, <hi>give the king thy judgments O God, and thy righteouſneſs to the kings ſon.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>David</hi> gave unto <hi>Solomon</hi> the charge for the building of the temple, and he gave him the pattern of it, and he exhorted him, and encouraged him to be <hi>ſtrong,</hi> and <hi>know the God of his fathers,</hi> and ſerve him with a perfect heart, and by computation, it took up, about ſix months before <hi>Davids</hi> death, that he was introducing <hi>Solomon</hi> in his room: ſo that I may ſay, here is a great deal of Chriſts kingdom demonſtrated. For all this was before the old ſtate was out, <hi>Solomon</hi> was actually enthroned and ſtated in the kingdom in his fathers time, and <hi>Solomon</hi> did exerciſe his kingly power as you know, 1 <hi>Kings</hi> chap. 1. <hi>v.</hi> 50.53. chap. 2.4.10.</p>
               <p>Now, I ſhall not apply theſe things yet, becauſe <hi>I</hi> am not come to my aſſumption, <hi>I</hi> am but laying my ground-work, but before <hi>I</hi> come to that, <hi>I</hi> muſt ſhew you the complexion of theſe days, and although theſe days <hi>are the days of the ſon of man,</hi> yet they are not ſuch days, wherein the glory of Chriſt and his king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom do ſhine forth without a cloud, and therefore for that, we muſt, have recourſe again unto our text.</p>
               <p>And you ſhall finde there, that <hi>theſe days of the ſon of man are days of an</hi> extraordinary nature, they are days, wherein the world ſhall be drowned in a floud of
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:57576:35"/>prophanes, and ſenſuality, and ſecurity, and this is in order to a making them fit for a floud of judgment, ſo it is ſaid here, <hi>As it was in the days of</hi> Noah, <hi>ſo ſhall it be in the days of the ſon of man.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Likewiſe, ſo alſo as it was in the days of <hi>Lot,</hi> not only doth this ſcripture witneſs this thing, that the <hi>days of the ſon of man</hi> will be of ſuch a nature and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexion, but likewiſe in <hi>Zach.</hi> 14. the Lord tells us, there, in ſeveral expreſſions, that are very Emphatical, as to what the nature of this day will be (one day) or a day by it ſelf (we may underſtand that by it) an odd day, ſuch a day as hath not been or ſhall be <hi>known by the Lord,</hi> as who ſhould ſay, none but the Lord ſhall know it. <hi>Neither day, nor night</hi> (that is a ſtrange day) neither clear nor dark, neither the one nor the other, but mixt of hoth.</p>
               <p>But <hi>at the evening tide, it ſhall be light,</hi> then it will clear up like it ſelf: briefly the days of the ſon of man will be a time of as prodigious wickedneſſes, of as great tryal to the ſaints, of as great calamity to the world, as ever days were, and beyond all preſident; ſo <hi>Daniel</hi> ſays, <hi>at that time ſhall</hi> Michael <hi>ſtand up, and it ſhall be a time of trouble ſuch as never was the like.</hi> But what then makes the title of the <hi>ſon of man,</hi> if there ſhall be ſuch days of trouble, is that title worth no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing in theſe days? I anſwer, there is a light ſide of theſe days, and that is to be ſeen by thoſe that have eyes, by thoſe that are ſpiritually enlightened to ſee; there will be a dark hope in all the people of God, and in all the whole creation in theſe days, that ſurely, there is ſomething in the womb of theſe diſpenſations that will revive them at the laſt, and this the blind world can ſee and ſay. But the ſaints (eſpecially, if
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:57576:35"/>they watch, and if they obtain that favour from the Lord, as <hi>Daniel</hi> did, that was a man of deſire) they may ſee, and will ſee, whither all things will tend, and where they will iſſue, and ſo they will be comfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted and they <hi>will ſing for the majeſty of the Lord,</hi> they will rejoice in that which God will create. They will be engaged actually with the Lord in creating <hi>a new heaven,</hi> and a <hi>new earth,</hi> this will be the mixt nature of theſe days, they will be prodigiouſly wicked da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ringly wicked and yet they are the <hi>days of the ſon of man,</hi> why ſo? becauſe it ſuits his deſigne upon all ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counts, that the Churches enemies might ſhew them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves like themſelves, that ſo his judgments might be the more conſpicuous; the more clear which he will bring upon them, and alſo that his people might have the tryal of their faith and ſenſe of their own weaknes and failings, and ſo (<hi>I</hi> ſay) it doth ſuit Gods end, who deſignes ſo to come, as that his day ſhould <hi>fall as a ſnare upon all that dwell on the earth,</hi> that there ſhall be no more likelihood of the day before his coming, then of many ages before, that ſo the mockers might be confirmed ſaying, <hi>where is the promiſe of his coming?</hi> as who ſhould ſay, you talk of Chriſts approach being neer, but there is no ſigne of it, not conſidering, that he <hi>comes as a thief,</hi> you your ſelves know perfectly ſays the Apoſtle, that the <hi>day of the Lord ſo cometh, Chriſt</hi> comes before the 7th vyal (that is) preparation is mak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing for his coming, It it his legal time yea it is his a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctual time before the the 7th. Phyal for ſayes he, <hi>be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold I come as a thief,</hi> ſhould now ſhew you the Paral<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lel, having ſpoken of the complexion, it is that which conforms this time to Gods former proceedings, There were ſuch days before God deſtroyed the old world
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:57576:36"/>120 <hi>years,</hi> Thoſe were <hi>the days of Noah,</hi> and the world was looked on as a drowned world from the beginning of thoſe days, and ſo the days of <hi>Lot</hi> from the time that <hi>Abraham,</hi> had reſcued the king of <hi>Sodom,</hi> and the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther four kings from their enemies, which was a ſigne of the four Monarchies, from whoſe hand, <hi>Abraham,</hi> the father of the faithful, delivered <hi>Lot,</hi> and for his ſake the reſt were delivered.</p>
               <p>Now it is probable, that from that time <hi>Lot</hi> uſed a greater freedom to admoniſh them, to make a better uſe of their deliverance, then they did; thoſe were the <hi>days of Lot,</hi> there were days then, there was a time for the judgments coming, but it was not fully come, ſo likewiſe doth Gods day prepare his enemies againſt ſuch a time that they may be as fuel dryed for the fire, that they may flame like a torch or a ſheaf, when fire is put to them.</p>
               <p>So likewiſe, he prepares the veſſels of mercy, I ſhall only tell you in our ſaviours time, there was from the denunciation of the judgments againſt <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> 40 years, and ſo likewiſe from our Saviours riſing, till his aſcention, there was 40. days wherein he was (as <hi>I</hi> may ſay) preparing himſelf for his aſcention to hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven.</p>
               <p>I might give you twenty Parallels of it, but now I come to the application of theſe things, to theſe days, and as for the ſtanding up of <hi>Michael,</hi> that is the firſt thing I would aſſume; that <hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chael</hi> is raiſed up, <hi>Michael</hi> hath ſtood up for ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral years, if others, in other parts of the world do queſtion this, yet we in thoſe parts have no reaſon to doubt of it, it is much, if we are not convinced of it, of the Lord Jeſus his ſtanding up, and addreſſing him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:57576:36"/>to promote and ſerve, in his own and his Churches intereſt above all intereſt, and all kingdoms of the world, that intereſt of the kingdom of God that hath lain hid in the faith of the Saints, and in the promiſes unto this time, if you ſay, what evidence can be made of this, it is a queſtion not becoming thoſe that have ſeen the great works of God, as we have done, have we not ſeen <hi>Michael ſtanding up:</hi> have we not ſeen him rouſing himſelf, have we not ſeen three nations bowing in his name, have we not ſeen an heaven, and an earth paſſing away? have we not ſeen a diſſolution of the Church, and ſtate, have we ſeen all this, and do we queſtion whether Chriſt hath ſet a foot his title, or no, you know, that kings when they are proclaim'd in this land, they begin in the Palace yard, they are not all over proclaimed in one moment. (So I ſay) the kingdom of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt is to be a riſing, and a growing kingdom, <hi>of the increaſe of his govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and of peace there ſhall be no end; and why may</hi> we not ſay, that this <hi>Iſland,</hi> or theſe three nations may reſemble the palace yard, where Chriſt is firſt pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claimed, he hath been brought to the Ancient of days by clouds of witneſſes, who have pleaded his intereſt with God, you know it hath been the ſubject of the ſaints prayers theſe 30. years yea nothing hath reliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed upon the ſpirits of the ſaints, that hath not related this way, if Chriſts kingdom hath not been at one end of it, it hath been no prayer, no ſermon, if it have not had that at one end of it, yea hath not the Lord Jeſus exerciſed his kingly power? hath he not made many overturnings, hath he not dealt with many <hi>Adonijahs,</hi> how many would have ſet themſelves up in his room? This is the account of all theſe quick revolutions, theſe
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:57576:37"/>overturnings, this is exceeding declarative of his be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing near, <hi>whoſe right it is,</hi> I ſhall therefore conclude with a word of uſe, or application, and it is this, <hi>Let us lift up our heads for the day of our redemption draws nigh.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I have already formerly, once and again told you, that theſe 45 days from the end of the 1290. days ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken of in <hi>Dan.</hi> 12. are that generation (as I conceive) in which our Saviour ſays, <hi>all things ſhall be fulfilled,</hi> for ſo were the generations from <hi>David</hi> to Chriſt (thoſe 14 generations) 43 years one with another.</p>
               <p>So in thoſe 45. days in <hi>Daniel,</hi> wherein <hi>Michael ſhall ſtand up,</hi> Daniel is told, that all ſhould be fulfil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led in that time, and I ſay theſe times began in the year 1650. and we are now in the middle of them (we are very forward) and I do more ſuſpect my ſelf for the ſetting my poſt too far off from Chriſts appearing, then of ſetting it too near; I ſay, I more ſuſpect my ſelf for that, and the Lord knows, <hi>i.e.</hi> (if you ſubdivide this laſt watch or ſpace of 45 years into leſſer watches,) in which of the watches, of this laſt watch, he may come, in the ſecond, or in the third watch, but we are neer to it, let us look up, and lift up our heads.</p>
               <p>You ſee what evidences have been given of theſe days.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Obj.</hi> But if Chriſts coming be ſo near, would the times be ſo evil may ſome ſay? <hi>I</hi> anſwer was not <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom</hi> at the worſt, when Chriſt came with the other two Angels to deſtroy them, and ſo the old world.</p>
               <p>Yea, but you will ſay, the people of God would be better then they are, if Chriſts coming were ſo near.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> They ſhall be made better by his coming, the ſummer ſpoken of, is the very appearing of Chriſt,
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:57576:37"/>you know that <hi>when the trees puts forth ſummer is night,</hi> but it is the appearing of Chriſt, is the ſummer, would you have fruit before ſummer? your fruits are grow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in the winter, and in the ſpring, they are coming forwards, but you have not your fruit till the ſummer; Chriſt is preparing his people by the preſent diſpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſations, and they ſhall ſhine, but all that Chriſt doth now is emptying work, cleanſing work, as when a man pulls down his old houſe, in order to building it anew, Chriſt is removing houſe and he is taking a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way joy from the earth, (the old joy) trade is going, the joy of the earth; and the very husbandman may looſe the fruits of the earth this year.</p>
               <p>And if you look within, O what deſolations are there? alas! though the Lord give us our wits and our ſences, yet we hear of one, in one place, under a ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of diſpondency, <hi>Gods fire is in Sion</hi> (in this day) <hi>and his furnace in Jeruſalem,</hi> and there is none of us, but have our back burdens, if it be but being compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions of ſuffering ones, it cannot but go to our hearts, this is the ſowing time, yea but you will ſay poſſibly.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Obj.</hi> There is a promiſe of the ſpirits pouring forth, and therefore theſe cannot be the days of the ſon of man, I anſwer the ſpirit is not the firſt grace, the lead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing grace, as in thoſe promiſes made to <hi>Iſrael</hi> in the let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, of bringing them back to their own. land, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 36.24.32. They muſt be in their own land and ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led there before the ſpirit is poured forth, leſt they ſhould reflect too much upon their own qualifications, leaſt thy may be ready to ſay, it is for our reformati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on that God hath viſited us.</p>
               <p>Therefore will the Lord at he t laſt (as at the firſt) take his people, in their blood, and in their unworthi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs.</p>
               <pb n="66" facs="tcp:57576:38"/>
               <p> 
                  <hi>Obj.</hi> But you may ſay, we ſee nothing of the Jews being called, and <hi>Antichriſt</hi> deſtroyed.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw. Antichriſt</hi> hath but a myſtical deſtruction till Chriſt comes, and there will be a Pope, for ought I know till Chriſt appears, but his time is legally out and determined, and when a time is out, what is done afterwards, is an uſurpation, and <hi>Antichriſt</hi> ſhall pay dearly for all at the laſt.</p>
               <p>But as for the Jews, it is a material objection, we cannot look for the appearance of Chriſt, till they come in, though on this occaſion; let us be aware that there is a miſtical Jew, that needs to be turned to the Lord, as well as a litteral Jew, but as to the litteral Jew, though we ſee him not come in, yet we know not how ſoon we may, for it ſhall be very ſuddenly, <hi>a nation ſhall be born at once</hi> (mark the expreſſion) though we do not ſee yet, have we heard nothing of the ratling of theſe dry bones? let others take it for what they pleaſe, for my part, I take it for a truth, and the rather the more, becauſe it is the time for them to appear and though they may be hid in the deſerts, for ſome time, it is not more then what their fathers were in their day, who lay ſtill by the ſpace of 37 years, in the wildernes of <hi>Cadeſh,</hi> and the people of the nations little concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed themſelves with them, nor they with them.</p>
               <p>Beſides, what we heard in the year 1665. when there were reports of their ſtirring, it is not impoſſible to ſhew you earlier ſtirrings, as we have it recorded of the year 1650. that there was a very great meeting of them in the plains of <hi>Ageda,</hi> where they ſet up tents, and there was a confluence from all parts, no leſſe then 300 Rabbies, that were able to ſhew their Genealogy, and in a very large tent, there was an orderly diſpute,
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:57576:38"/>where they did with great ingenuity and candor put the queſtion, whether the <hi>Meſſiah</hi> was come, or not? Then came in the Prieſts, and Jeſuites with their vicar, and their breaden God, and made them break up in diſorder: nay what if I ſhould ſay unto you that Chriſt hath ſhew'd himſelf to that nation diſtinctly, it is cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly related that he ſhewed himſelf in the year 53. in <hi>Frankenland</hi> upon the croſs, and that he was there ſo ſeen by thouſands of ſpectators with his Angels about him, as if that very word of <hi>Daniel</hi> were in fulfilling, and that the Angels were preſenting him to the Ancient. of days, repreſenting that in a viſionary way then, which is the work of the day ſtill in the hearts of the ſaints, through the interceſſion of the ſpirit. I ſpeak it only for this (my beloved friends) for that I know (I feel) that we need the quickning of this conſideration, we are amuſed with the times that we are in, and do not know what <hi>Iſrael</hi> is to do, becauſe we do not know, nor diſcern the times; look to it, and take heed of ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curity, take heed of an unwatchful frame of ſpirit, for theſe are <hi>the days of the ſon of man.</hi>

<pb n="68" facs="tcp:57576:39"/>us, things that are not to be in our day, nor in the days of our children, we are apt to put off, therefore I made it my buſineſs in two or three diſcourſes to ſhew you the nearneſs of this coming of Chriſt; I ſhewed it you, firſt, by the expiration of the times of <hi>the man of ſin,</hi> and Secondly, by the ſignes of Chriſts coming being fulfilled, pitching chiefly upon thoſe ſignes in <hi>Math.</hi> 24. And in two other of the Evangeliſts of the <hi>ſuns be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing darkned,</hi> and the <hi>moon</hi> being <hi>turned into blood.</hi> The third time I ſhewed you, that theſe are the <hi>days of the ſon of man</hi> by ſeveral particulars, and (by ſomething I had ſpoken) devolving our diſcourſe to that point; I pitcht upon thoſe words in the 17 of this Goſpel. Where our ſaviour ſpeaks of the <hi>days of the ſon of man,</hi> and paralels them with the <hi>days of Noah</hi> and <hi>Lot,</hi> which <hi>I</hi> told you doth intimate to us, that there is a tract of time from the expiration of the 42 months <hi>(of the man of ſin)</hi> to the glorious revelation of the <hi>ſon of man</hi> in perſon from heaven, and that this tract of time is cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led <hi>the days of the ſon of man,</hi> wherein, he is preparing to ſet forward unto this glorious expedition.</p>
               <p>Now in theſe <hi>days of the ſon of man, I</hi> did partly o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen to you what was to be done, and ſhewed you ſome figurative delineation of this work by former types, and eſpecially in the inveſting of <hi>Solomon</hi> into the kingdom; <hi>I</hi> ſhewed you, that before <hi>Davids</hi> death <hi>Solomon</hi> was ſet upon the throne, and in opening of thoſe paſſages, we ſound them to caſt a great light up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on ſome prophetical paſſages, that we meet with in <hi>Daniel:</hi> As about the bringing of the ſon of man, to <hi>the Ancient of days,</hi> which <hi>I</hi> told you doth very aptly a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree with that type of <hi>Solomon</hi> to <hi>David</hi> (bringing him unto remembrance, as <hi>I</hi> may ſay) which was done by
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:57576:39"/>
                  <hi>Bathſheba,</hi> by the advice of <hi>Nathan</hi> the prophet, ſhe goes to <hi>David,</hi> and puts him in minde of his oath, and ſhe is ſeconded by <hi>Nathan,</hi> and thereupon <hi>David</hi> doth ſend to anoint <hi>Solomon,</hi> and to ſet him upon the throne, and all this was in <hi>Davids</hi> life time: Now the obſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion <hi>I</hi> made from theſe things, was this, <hi>David</hi> you know was a figure of the militant ſtate of Chriſts king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, his ſetting <hi>Solomon</hi> upon his throne before his own death, doth intimate to us, that, before the militant ſtate is ſwallowed up (as <hi>I</hi> may ſay) of victory, (or of the triumphant ſtate of the Church) Chriſt is to be ſet upon the throne; as the ſucceeding links in a chain do enter into the former links, ſo doth Chriſts time take hold of the former times, even as <hi>Jacob</hi> took hold of <hi>Eſau</hi> his brother.</p>
               <p>From thence <hi>I</hi> came, in the winding up, to ſhew you that Chriſt was entred upon his kingdome, and that there were many acts paſſed in order to Chriſts glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous raign, and that he had laid his claim in partionlar, to theſe three nations, and had been proclaimed here, as in the palace yard (as <hi>I</hi> might ſay) of his dominions.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>I</hi> gave you alſo many concurrent paſſages, that have faln in, to ſtrengthen our faith, and anſwered ſome objections touching the calling of the Jews, which although we do not yet ſee, called to the knowledge of Chriſt, is not to trouble us, foraſmuch, as their calling is not to be expected, untill they be ſetled in their own land. For ſo the promiſe ſeems to caſt things, in that order, that God will as freely look upon them, even in their blood, as he did at the firſt, when they were in <hi>Egypt,</hi> that ſo it may not be ſaid, that their turning to God did lead the Lords turning to them.</p>
               <p>Yet <hi>I</hi> told you, that we have heard of the ratling of
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:57576:40"/>thoſe dry bones, which (becauſe the time is come) ſhould make us take heed of ſaying, there is nothing in it, though we are not acquainted with the poſture of their affairs, how they ſtand ſince that, only <hi>I</hi> told you, that we may have this reſerve of hope, that as when they came out of <hi>Egipt,</hi> they lay 37 years in the wilderneſs of <hi>Cadeſb,</hi> and probably were as much out of the eye of the nations, for a great part of that time, as they are out of our eye now.</p>
               <p>So <hi>I</hi> ſay, God may be forming that people ſecretly in the dark, and may be carrying on his intended good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes towards them, and we may ſee the ſun of their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption, and reſtitution ſuddenly break forth of the clouds, although we do not hear of them every day.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>I</hi> ſhould now come to ſhew the nature of this coming of Chriſt, which is here held forth to us in theſe words, <hi>When he will return from the wedding,</hi> but before <hi>I</hi> come to them, <hi>I</hi> muſt make a little uſe of that word, <hi>I</hi> have already hinted. Uſe, Firſt, if it be ſo, that we are in <hi>the days of the ſon of man,</hi> that is, in that genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion which Chriſts ſpeaks of in <hi>Math.</hi> 24. and the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Evangeliſts (when theſe ſignes of his coming are to have their courſe, and in the rear of them all, Chriſt is to appear.)</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>I</hi> ſay, if we be in that generation which probably is that 45 years ſpoken of by <hi>Daniel</hi> at the end of 1290. days (and which 45 years <hi>I</hi> have told you by compu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation is one half of it run out, or very near, for there is but this difference between chronologers of a matter of 3 years, from whence the 1290 commence, either in 360 or 363. from Chriſt). All agree, it was in <hi>Julians</hi> time, and ſome ſay in 360, others ſay in 363. there is but that difference, and ſo accordingly they came out
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:57576:40"/>in 1650 or 53. ſo that <hi>I</hi> ſay there muſt be half, or very neer of the 45 days following, expyred.</p>
               <p>Uſe, Then in the firſt place, this ſhews us, that there hath been nothing in all that cry, that hath been of the <hi>day of the Lord,</hi> which hath been proclaimed by ſeveral voices, and by ſeveral ſpirits, and indeed the diſreputation that hath been brought upon it by ſome mouths and ſpirits that have been the trumpeters of it: hath made others (<hi>I</hi> ſay it hath made many ſober and cautious ſpirits) decline it, and to have no pleaſure in it. But if that would be a good argument againſt the truth, becauſe the devil himſelf doth acknowledg it, ſurely then men ſhould have diſowned Chriſt, in this day.</p>
               <p>For you know, that ſpirits of divination, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clean ſpirits did confeſs him, and acknowledge him, and ſuch as were reputed deviliſh, but the truth was nevertheleſs the truth, for being taken up, by unclean lips.</p>
               <p>The intent of this Uſe is, that we may gather up, and not loſe even that teſtimony, which hath been given of <hi>the day of the Lord,</hi> and that from good evidence, from the ſence of it, the experience of it, the feelings of the workings of it, in the ſpirits and affairs of men.</p>
               <p>Surely there can be no account given of theſe won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derful changes that we have ſeen, not only in this out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward world, but in the inward world too, unhinging, and unhorſing and bringing down all the glory of man, <hi>I</hi> ſay, no other account of it, can be given, but that the <hi>days of the ſon of man</hi> are come in; It's true, they are mixt days, and ſo <hi>I</hi> told you all along. <hi>Neither day nor night, neither clear nor dark,</hi> as <hi>Zachariah</hi> ſays, in his 14. chap. They are days by themſelves, as <hi>I</hi> may
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:57576:41"/>ſay, days full of trouble, as <hi>Daniel</hi> ſays, it ſhall be a time of trouble, ſuch as never was, and yet days, that have in the womb of them ſuch a birth, ſuch a glorious birth and bleſſing for the world (for the whole creation as well as the people of God) as no former times have had.</p>
               <p>They are days (as <hi>I</hi> may ſay) wherein Chriſt is in the mount with God, ereating, and taking inſtructions (as <hi>I</hi> may ſpeak with holy reverence) for the admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtration of his kingly office in this world; as <hi>Moſes</hi> the typical mediator was in the mount 40. days, and 40 nights, receiving his inſtructions for the people, let not the expreſſion offend you it is ſaid in the <hi>Pſalms, give thy jadgments O God to the king,</hi> and thy <hi>righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs to the kings ſon.</hi> Which need be no more ſtrange to us (that Chriſt ſhould receive his judgments from the father) then that he ſhould receive the revelations from the father, which he owns <hi>(the revelation that God gave to him, to ſhew unto his ſervants things ſhortly to come to paſs.)</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now, becauſe <hi>I</hi> have mentioned that of <hi>Moſes,</hi> do but conſider what fell out in the mean time, <hi>Moſes</hi> was in the mount with God, and although the people had ſeen the Lord, coming down upon the mount, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter ſuch a terrible manner, yet while <hi>Moſes.</hi> linge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red and ſtayed in the mount, they fell to Idolatry, they made the calf: is not this a wonderful thing; that they ſhould go turn aſide, <hi>I</hi> tell you, there hath been as great an apoſtacy from theſe <hi>days of Chriſt,</hi> from that hope, and that witneſs that was given of the <hi>day of the Lord,</hi> but it is no other, then what our ſaviour himſelf had foretold us, <hi>Math.</hi> 25. there you finde, the <hi>vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gins</hi> going forth to meet the <hi>Bridegroom;</hi> it is ſaid, <hi>there
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:57576:41"/>was a cry at midnight,</hi> ſaying, <hi>behold the bridegroom com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth,</hi> and yet after all this, <hi>while the Bridegroom tarryed, they all ſlumbered and ſlept,</hi> and ſo it is at this day, theſe days of <hi>the ſon of man</hi> are not excluſive of trouble, and of ſtrange ſpirits; the devil, when he ſees, that men are awakened, and he cannot hinder it, but they have an expectation of the Bridegrooms coming, he will mingle heaven and earth together, if it be poſſible.</p>
               <p>He ruſhes in with all his deluſions, he ſeeks to blaſt this hope, theſe expectations of the ſaints, all manner of ways; and if we had been well adviſed (as I may ſay) and had known the Scripture, we might have ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected a ſtorm, to be poured out upon us, even a ſtorm of inward exerciſes and tryals, as well as out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward troubles.</p>
               <p>Theſe <hi>days of the ſon of man</hi> are days, <hi>which none of the wicked do underſtand, as Daniel</hi> obſerves, <hi>but the wiſe ſhall underſtand;</hi> they are days, wherein Chriſt comes privately (as it is here intimated, that when he cometh, and <hi>knocketh, you may open unto him immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>atly;</hi> it is that which is not unuſual among men, for Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſadors of Princes to come in, privately at firſt, and to be adviſed with about their publick reception, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they make their publick entry, Chriſt comes alſo privately to his own, and his glorious appearance in his adequate perſon (man as well as God) comes in the rear of all.</p>
               <p>So that (I ſay) let us not loſe the things, that God hath wrote, It is true, there is danger on the other hand, (that is) of crying up, the preſent day, for the time of Chriſts appearance, and if it were worth the while, or that I were competent for ſuch a buſineſs, we might ſhew you, that this notion of Chriſts being come; and
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:57576:42"/>of the day of the Lords being come, ſhutting up all the expectations of the ſaints within the preſent per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formances, doth offend ſeveral ways, it offends againſt the order of the works and appearances of God, who hath ſet times and ſeaſons for all his purpoſes.</p>
               <p>If Chriſts day be as much, as it ever ſhall be, it doth mix and confound all things together, it makes <hi>Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chriſts</hi> day, yea you may as well confound his firſt, and his ſecond appearance together, it is ſaid, <hi>he hath ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed a day, wherein he will judge the world,</hi> it is not now, but it is appointed, ſo the Apoſtle directs the hope of believers to another day, and you will not ſay, but that Chriſt was come to them in the ſpirit, yet they waited for a further day, the Apoſtle himſelf ſays, <hi>he had not yet attayned, nor was as yet perfect,</hi> ſo that (I ſay) this doth ſtrike at the order of Gods working and appearances, and as the Apoſtle ſays concerning the reſurrection, thoſe that ſay, the reſurrection is paſt, deſtroy the faith of ſome: It is a deſtroying of our faith, and of our comfort, to hold forth this to be the day of Chriſt, to be the time of Chriſts appearance, the all that we were to expect.</p>
               <p>I confeſs, it is not to be wondered at, in the Prelati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Church, that they would have us to expect nothing but tribulation in this world and perſecution, the Church of Chriſt (ſay they) muſt travel under the croſs, nntil the laſt judgment until they come to heaven, though they minde not to do ſo themſelves, nay this they preach to others, that they themſelves may ride upon the high places of the earth, they would keep the people ſtill in ignorance and blindneſs of that day of Chriſt, which when it comes will abaſe all the <hi>pride and loftynes of man,</hi> as you have it in <hi>Eſay</hi> 2.</p>
               <pb n="75" facs="tcp:57576:42"/>
               <p> It will abaſe things that are high, and exalt things that are low, <hi>the vallyes ſhall be exalted, and the moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains and hills ſhall be brought low.</hi> But that any that are ſpiritual, ſhould go to deſtroy the faith, of themſelves, and their brethren, by taking the preſent diſpenſation for the full performance of the promiſe, is that which may be juſtly wondered at, and it is not certainly with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out a great deſigne of Satan, thus to beguil them, and through them to endeavour to beguil others of the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort, and the hope of Chriſts appearance, and of the redemption of the body: It is true, there may be a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velation of the day of Chriſt in the ſpirit, and this may be given forth at any time, <hi>Abraham</hi> ſaw Chriſts day though he lived many ages before Chriſts time; and ſo <hi>John was in the ſpirit on the Lords day,</hi> but yet notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding, <hi>John</hi> tells us, that this day of Chriſt, was to come on orderly, there is ſuch a ſeries of times and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidences, ſo many ſcenes that are to be preſented be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore that concluding ſcene, before Chriſts ſitting on the <hi>white throne:</hi> There were ſo many ſeals to be opened, ſo many trumpets to be ſounded, it is true, there was a glorious day in the primitive times, but that was but the firſt fruits.</p>
               <p>And it is called (<hi>I</hi> conceive) the firſt fruits, becauſe it was anſwering to the firſt fruits under the law, for there were three ſeaſts, three times in the year, <hi>all the males in</hi> Iſrael <hi>were to appear before the Lord,</hi> there was the feaſt of the <hi>paſſover,</hi> and the feaſt of the <hi>firſt fruits</hi> (which was at <hi>Pentecoſt,</hi> the very time when the ſpirit came down upon the Apoſtles, as fulfilling that feaſt) and there was the feaſt of <hi>ingathering,</hi> or the <hi>feaſt of tabernacles,</hi> and it was in the feaſt that you finde written in <hi>Joh.</hi> 7.37. <hi>In the laſt day, that great day of
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:57576:43"/>the feaſt, Jeſus cryed, and ſaid,</hi> &amp;c. This feaſt of ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bernacles held ſeveral days (there were 7 days that it was kept) and ſo this feaſt that in the Antitype anſwers to the feaſt of tabernacles, may take in all this genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion that I ſpeak of, (the 45 years of this laſt generati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on) <hi>the days of the ſon of man.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But mark ye, in the cloſe of this time (that is the great day) then will Chriſt appear in his glorious equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>page, with all his holy Angels, then will he come both in his <hi>own glory, and in the glory of his father,</hi> and of <hi>all his holy Angels,</hi> and till Chriſt hath his full glory, we cannot expect the full effuſion of his ſpirit.</p>
               <p>The ſpirit will not be <hi>poured upon all fleſh,</hi> the earth will not be filled <hi>with the knowledge of the Lord, as the waters cover the ſea,</hi> till that great day of the feaſt, till that laſt, and great day of the feaſt.</p>
               <p>So that (I ſay) take heed of taking part of payment for the whole, tis true, theſe are the <hi>days of the ſon of man,</hi> and I do believe that from this time you ſhall ſee the intereſt of the ſon of man, riſeing and growing more and more, all things ſhall work unto that glorious iſſue, thoſe that are wiſe ſhall ſee it every day, to them, <hi>day unto day will utter knowledge,</hi> I ſay the intereſt of Chriſt is on the riſing hand ſtill, and all oppoſite intereſts are in the way of declyning, and therefore let us prepare for him, we have ſeen ſomething already of the <hi>day of the Lord</hi> upon things that have been high and lifted up, let us look to ſee it yet more, the Lord will abuſe the loftyneſs of man both of one ſort and of another, I tell you, there is a great deal of haughtineſs, which the Lord will abuſe even in his own people, and in their ſpiritual affairs, it is ſaid in <hi>Zeph.</hi> 3.11. <hi>In that day, ſhalt thou not be aſhamed for all thy doings, whorein thou haſt
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:57576:43"/>tranſgreſſed againſt me? for then will I take out of the midſt of thee, them that rejoice in thy pride, and thou ſhalt no more be haughty, becauſe of my holy mountain,</hi> this Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture doth hold forth unto you, the proceſs of the day of God (or of theſe days of the ſon of man) they are humbling days to all.</p>
               <p>God by theſe diſpenſations which have paſſed over us, hath been bringing his people to this paſſe, he hath been working upon them, that neceſſarie qualification of making them an afflicted and poor people; <hi>I</hi> remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber very well, that the firſt time I ſpake here (when your deſires gave me a call to make a little ſupply of that place, that was deſtitute by the removal of that eminent help, that did appear uſually, in this place before) <hi>I</hi> told you, then that for my part, I was one that was ſpoiled by this day of the Lord, and I muſt own and confeſs unto you, that there is nothing doth reliſh, nor can reliſh with me, of the old glory of the excellency of man, though I know that all of us have <hi>a young tooth in our heads,</hi> as the proverb is, and we ſhould willingly be ſomething among men, but the Lord hath mercifully ſhut the door, againſt any ſuch hope, or expectation, and therefore let it not enter in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to our hearts, for God hath forbid the banes, we muſt never touch with any ſuch things more, for <hi>God is ſtayn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the pride of all glory,</hi> though ſpiritual diſcoveries have all along unhorſed, and I may ſay unmanned us (I mean the Lords people) yet 'tis now the work of the day, more eminentlie. What was <hi>Paul</hi> in his time? rude in ſpeech, <hi>I come not to you in excellency of ſpeech, or in mans wiſdom,</hi> he accounted all thoſe things <hi>dung and droſs.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And trulie (I ſay) our ordinances, and adminiſtrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:57576:44"/>our miniſtrings one to another, the miniſtring of paſtors to their congregations, and the mannaging, of our affairs, &amp; our fellowſhips; muſt become more and more in the ſpirit, leſs in man, leſs in the wiſdom of man, and more in the power of God, or elſe this day, that is coming, will throw it all to the ground.</p>
               <p>And therefore, happie will thoſe be, that are as that carkaſs, that Chriſt ſpeaks of in the end of <hi>Luke</hi> 17. <hi>where the carcaſſe is, thither will the Eagles be gathered together;</hi> that man, that is made as a carcaſſe (that is all his own life, beautie, and activitie it is all gone) the Eagles of reſurrection life and glorie will deſcend upon that carcaſſe, and take it up into themſelves, or the Eagles are an Emblem of the reſurrection, in caſting their bill.</p>
               <p>And theſe are they, that the day of the Lord comes to revive; It comes to ſave the poor and needie, it is not ſo much the poor and needy in purſe, for alas ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie of the wicked are ſo (manie of Chriſts enemies are ſo) the Devil hath not power to make all his children rich, if he had, it would be a ſad world and intollera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, but the poor and needy, that ſhall be ſaved, and comforted in this day, are the poor and needie in ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit; ſuch as are indeed nothing in their own eyes, and therefore the world deſpiſes them, they are ſuch whoſe <hi>life is hid with Chriſt in God,</hi> and God will rebuke us (as he hath done,) he will rebuke our life, whereby we are apt to court too much the glory of this firſt cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation; by which we are defiled (I ſay) the Lord is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buking our life inwards, and when this day of the Lord comes (his glorious appearance) it will find his people in the moſt forelorn and deſolate condition of any people; <hi>I will leave in the midſt of thee, an afflcted

(I ſay ſtill remember this) that this day of the Lord hath a quarrel only with the undue exaltation of things, it hath only a quarrel with the fleſh, with the glory of the fleſh; I do not ſay, but that God will recompence, and doth in his people, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compence all that he takes from them in the fleſh, with inward minifeſtations, yea, let me tell you, yet more, the day of Chriſt (even theſe days which are begun, theſe days of the ſon of man) as they do pull down with one hand, ſo they will be building up with the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. And the new world, the new ſtate of things, ſhall grow up gradual he, even as this old world finkes and declines: the Lord hath (I ſay) this double work in hand, and though he deſtroy the old foundations, that we are apt to build upon, yet he will ſubſtitute, even under them, a new foundation, out of which all our comforts ſhall ſpring and grow up; that ſo (as the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle ſays) <hi>being uncloathed, we ſhall not be found naked.</hi> God will not pull down this old world about the ears of his people, but he will have a new ſtate of things, everlaſting habitations readie to receive them, and this new ſtate of things ſhall grow up out of Chriſt, and out of a root in the ſpirit, ſtrangelie, wonderful he, <hi>God ſhall do a new thing in the earth, a woman ſhall compaſs a man,</hi> God will ſerve his people by ſuch hands, and ſuch inſtruments, as they did little expect it from, as we begin to ſee at this day, that ſo we may learn ever from hence, to take heed of comparing the inſtrument with him, who is the workman, but that it is God, whatever the inſtrument be: he will make the <hi>beaſts of the field to honor him, he will open rivers to <gap reason="illegible: blotted" extent="1 word">

               <p>And thus will he <hi>bring the blind by a way, that they know not, and will make darkneſs light before them;</hi> ſo that God doth not father pul down the old fram, but he is as forward with his new frame, and though it be not all in our ſight, but like curious peices, which are pul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led in from the tumult of vulgar obſervers, yet when the works is finiſhed, the vail ſhall be drawn aſide, and we ſhall ſee it a verie glorious piece. I have been lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger then I thought for, detain'd from the words which I ſhould come to, of Chriſts <hi>returning from the wedding,</hi> I ſee, I ſhall but make an entrance into them now.</p>
               <p>I ſhall give you a little general view of it, and the ſenſe and meaning of the words, as the Lord doth o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen them to me.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ye your ſelves like unto men, that wayt for their Lord, when he ſhall return from the wedding, that when he cometh and knocketh, they may open unto him immediatly,</hi> This enters us upon the nature of Chriſts coming, he comes as a Bridegroom, indeed he is to be look'd upon under ſeveral notions in his coming, he comes as a judge, and an avenger, <hi>ſhall not God avenge his own e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect, that cry day and night unto him?</hi> but that that hath the preceedency of all other conſiderations, and is eſpecially in the eye of his ſaints, is, his coming as a Bridegroom, <hi>behold the Bridegroom cometh.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But here is a great difficulty in the text, and that is, it is ſaid here, he comes <hi>from the wedding,</hi> 'tis not ſaid when he co<gap reason="illegible: blotted" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="81" facs="tcp:57576:45"/>return out of the wedding; now this doth not hinder, but that he comes to the wedding, as other Scriptures intimate, but what is this wedding that he comes from, and why is he ſaid to come from the wedding? I anſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer, Firſt the wedding that Chriſt comes from, is (I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive) the glorious inveſtiture of his own perſon, as he is our head and repreſentative in the glory of the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and in the glory of his kingdom, that is the wed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding he comes from.</p>
               <p>And his coming is not only to publiſh, but to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part the glory and the fellowſhip of this glorious mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage with his Church here on earth; there are four weddings of Chriſt (as we may ſay)</p>
               <p>There was his wedding in Eternity, of which <hi>Solo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon</hi> ſpeaks in <hi>Proverbs</hi> 8th. <hi>Then was I by him, as one brought up with him.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Chriſt was the image <hi>of the inviſible God, from</hi> eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, and ſo he was his ſpouſe, and his temple.</p>
               <p>The Second wedding was Chriſts marrying our na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, in the low eſtate of it, marrying our raggs, and infirmities, <hi>the word made fleſh.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The third wedding is Chriſts returning unto the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and being glorifyed with <hi>the ſame glory, that he had with him before the world was,</hi> for which he prays in <hi>John</hi> 17.</p>
               <p>And then the fourth and laſt wedding is, that of Chriſt to his Church at his Second coming, when he will come to receive them to himſelf, as he ſays, <hi>if I go, I will come again, and receive you to my ſolf.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now it is the 3d wedding, that Chriſt comes from, comes out of that to his poor afflicted Church here up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on earth, to take them into the fellowſhip of his own glory, and this little prepoſition (<gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>) doth import
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:57576:46"/>unto us, that Chriſt is influenced, he comes influenced from the glory that he hath at the fathers right hand to impart it, to leaven his body the Church with it, with that kingdom, and that glory, and ſo I take that paſſage in <hi>Rev.</hi> 21. to import, <hi>Behold he that ſits up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the throne, ſaith, behold I make all things now.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>As much as if we ſhould ſuppoſe Chriſt to be thus ſpeaking and deliberating with himſelf, ſaying, here I am in glory, here I am at the right hand of power, all things are made ſubject to me, principallities, and powers, things in heaven, and things in earth.</p>
               <p>But my poor miſtical body lyes ſtill in the earth, in the ſudds, lyes under afflictions, temptations, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmity, why now (ſays Chriſt) I cannot longer forbear, I have along time held my peace, but now (ſays he) <hi>I will cry like a travelling woman,</hi> I muſt have my ſpouſe with me, where I am: and thus he comes influenced from his own glory, to impart this glory to them; and this now he is doing all this 45 years. Let it not offend you, that I ſpeak ſo much of the time; if the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture did not ſpeak of it, I ſhould not be ſo bold, but both the old, and new teſtament ſpeak of it: Chriſt tells us of a generation <hi>that ſhall not paſſe, till all be fulfill'd,</hi> when theſe things begins to appear, that generation will give you your deſire ere it go out. Now I ſay, all this time, Chriſt is taking private order with his Saints, and with his people, for this publick recepti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of his in the world, and that is the reaſon of what is ſaid here: That when he <hi>cometh and knocketh, ye may o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen to him, immediatly;</hi> though I grant you, there is more implyed in this, then meerly Chriſts ſpiritual viſits unto his people, which hath been in all times more or leſſe; but the meaning is, that in theſe times, more
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:57576:46"/>eſpecially Chriſt is doing ſuch things in the world in order to his kingdom, as he would have his people, underſtand them, as knocks of Chriſt, their beloved.</p>
               <p>And I wiſh (with all my ſoul) that the Churches may hear Chriſts knocks at their door, he knocks and knocks, and knocks, he knocks by all the rents and diviſions, that are among them.</p>
               <p>And this is a comfort to the ſaints (thoſe whoſe joy is in him) not that the truth of our communion with Chriſt ſhall be diſowned by him, but there is a cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring upon us, that muſt be taken off, And as it was ſaid of <hi>John</hi> the Baptiſt, that Chriſt <hi>muſt ircreaſe,</hi> and he <hi>muſt decreaſe,</hi> (he ſpeaks it not of his own perſon only or chiefly, but of his adminiſtration) ſo I ſay there hath been ſuch knocks by rents, and diviſions, there are ſuch rents at all our doors.</p>
               <p>How hath the Lord been knocking, to give us notice that the old world is marching off, and a new world is a coming, now <hi>bleſſed are they that do watch</hi> and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand the Lord, and are born up by that hope and expectation, and though he comes to diſſolve many marriages, that we have made, and to take us out of the armes of thoſe that are with us, yet he comes to ſolemniſe the bleſſed wedding between us and himſelf.</p>
               <p>Now (I tell you) what that marriage will be even the taking of us into the fellowſhip of his own glory, as he ſayes of the body in <hi>Phil.</hi> 3. that he will trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form our vile bodyes, and make them like his own glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious body, ſo I ſay, as he will do this with our bodies which is the laſt thing, ſo he will do the ſame with our ſpirits; and this is the work he is carrying on now, and we ſhould be opening unto him immediatly, and we ſhould be aware, that the Lord is entred upon his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fyning
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:57576:47"/>work, and he will ſit as a refyner, it is not a tranſient act, a buſines to be done at a ſitting, but he will ſet to it, though the compleating of it will be in the <hi>twinkling of an eye,</hi> but Chriſt is at work.</p>
               <p>Therefore if we do but know the <hi>gift of God,</hi> it may be a help to us to look for this hope from Chriſt. He hath begun to betake himſelf to his great reigne, the waters have forſaken their wonted channel, and they run backwards; God turns the ſpirits of nations, the ſpirits of powers, and what great things we may ſee in a little time, we know not; I tell you Gods laſt works are very quick, as things that draw near to their cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter uſually are.</p>

               <p>THat which I had in my eye, when I firſt took this text, I have been kept off from all this while, that I have been ſpeaking upon theſe words, which was to adminiſter a word (as the Lord ſhould give it into me) to aſſiſt that preparation the Lord calls for, in theſe words; that we might not be found unready, and in an immeet poſture at Chriſts appearance: Now, that which hath retarded theſe inſtructions, hath been my deſire to ſet before you; the important call of the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent times to concern <hi>your ſelves</hi> about theſe things; for we are apt to put off that work which the preſent exigency of affairs doth not require at our hands; eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially if it be unpleaſant work, as this work is unto the fleſh; to break from this world, to pull up our ſtakes out of this world; I ſay it is a work we are not forward to, until we needs muſt, till there is an imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diate call to it, and an indiſpenſable neceſſity for it, men are apt to put it off, and with the fluggard, <hi>to turn them ſelves in their beds,</hi> concluding, as he; I may have qne nap longer. I may ſleep a little longer, therefore, I have deſired to ſet before you the nearneſs of the coming of Chriſt, though indeed I did not think to have
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:57576:48"/>taken that ſcope; when I firſt took up theſe words, to let out my thoughts ſo freely, as I have done to you. But beginning with the ſignes of the times in <hi>Math.</hi> 24. I know not how, the diſcourſe devolved it ſelf upon the <hi>days of the ſon of man,</hi> and it was thus, thoſe ſignes in <hi>Math.</hi> 24. are by our Saviour (as they ſeem at leaſt to me and many others) all of them bounded within a generation, and we find in <hi>Daniel,</hi> that which doth comport with this, <hi>Dan.</hi> 12.</p>
               <p>We find there two numbers, the latter of which is 45 years, which I have told you, is much after the proportion of the generations from <hi>David</hi> to Chriſt, and it is ſaid, thoſe 45. years which follow the 1290, days ſhall bring us to that glorious ſtate, that top, that pitch, that perfection, that he is bleſſed that waites, and comes to the end of thoſe days, yea we find in the 17. of this Goſpel, the <hi>days of the ſon of man,</hi> not a <hi>day,</hi> but <hi>days,</hi> and parelling them with the <hi>days of Noah,</hi> and the <hi>days of Lot,</hi> they muſt of neceſſity be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood of a tract of time preceeding his glorious viſible appearance, in which, his appearance ſhall be draw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing on; ſo in theſe <hi>days of the ſon of man</hi> that great Cataſtrophy is drawing on upon the world, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore by way of correſpondence, as anſwering thoſe times, it is ſuggeſted to us that there are ſuch <hi>days of the ſon of man;</hi> and I likewiſe gave you, by calculation and computation, that we are in the very mideſt of thoſe days, thoſe 45. years.</p>
               <p>I am very ſenſible, that this computation, to dwell much upon it, may not be ſo acceptable to ſerveral hearers, I ſhall only make this Apology for my ſelf, that it is an argument of great comfort and hope to my ſelf, and it is that which I have found a need of, even
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:57576:48"/>to underſtand the times, and for any that are, it may be not ſo we pleaſed with ſuch diſcourſe, yet if it could be let into them, and that an evidence could be made to them, that the coming of our Lord were ſo nigh, I am perſwaded, they would have as much com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort in it, as I have; though I grant this, that this is ſuch a knowledg, as is gained by the comparing Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture with Scripture, it is a light of prophecy, which I will grant you is but an exterior means, and <hi>he that hath the teſtimony of Jeſus, hath the ſpirit of prophecy.</hi> And could you read the works of God, and his goings in Chriſt, and in your own ſouls, in conformity unto Chriſt, you might ſee the very original mould (as I may ſay) in which all times are caſt, you might ſee the pattern, according to which God doth faſhion, and frame all his diſpenſations, both to the Church, and to the world.</p>
               <p>But I ſhall no longer hold you on this, the laſt time I began to enter upon the nature of Chriſts coming, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving ſpoken of the nearneſſe, we come now to the p<gap reason="illegible: faint" extent="1+ letters">

                  </gap>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of it, which is held forth unto us under a ſeveral notion; Chriſt comes as a <hi>Lord,</hi> to take account of his ſervants, and he comes as a <hi>Bridegroom</hi> to take them into the fellowſhip of his own glory, he comes alſo as a <hi>Saviour</hi> to redeem <hi>Iſrael</hi> out of all his troubles, and he comes as a <hi>Judge,</hi> and a <hi>revenger,</hi> to deſtroy his e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies, but that which hath the precedency here in the text, is his coming as a <hi>Bridegroom.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And I told you, the laſt day, that there are four wed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dings, there is,</p>
               <p>Firſt, the marriage of Chriſt in eternity to his head, ſpoken of in <hi>Prov.</hi> 8.</p>
               <p>Secondly, there is Chriſts coming down out of that
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:57576:49"/>glory to marry our infirmities, <hi>the word was made fleſh.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thirdly, there is Chriſts return with the ſpoils of this created image unto heaven, and marrying that un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the glory of his heavenly man, and then,</p>
               <p>Fourthly, there is the return of Chriſt again the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond time from heaven, to fetch up, the individual per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, and members of his body myſtical, into a fellow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip with himſelf, in the ſame glory.</p>
               <p>Now our buſineſs (I told you) that we are imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diatly concern'd about, is, the third marriage, when he ſhall return from the wedding, <hi>you your ſelves like unto men that looks for their Lord, when he comes from the wedding,</hi> what wedding is this? It is from the wed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding which he hath ſolemniſed in heaven of our natures unto the <hi>ſon of man in heaven,</hi> this poor ſmitten nature Chriſt takes at the utmoſt diſadvantages of it, under all the ſin and ſhame; and meanneſs and poverty of it, he hath marryed it to the ſon of man in heaven, to the heavenly glory.</p>
               <p>Marke ye, not our perſons, but our nature, this is the wedding from which he comes, and he comes now to take our perſons to marry them, into the ſame glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry.</p>
               <p>Indeed theſe three latter weddings, they are all in purſuance of the firſt, and they are all to end and ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minate there, the firſt wedding which is the marriage of Chriſt unto his head (which was in eternity) this is the glorious exemplar, and this is the reſt of the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of God by him, thus to be brought to God.</p>
               <p>And all that was after wards, it was but a glorious project, for the enriching and embelliſhing of that marriage (as I may ſay).</p>
               <p>As if the Lord could not ſhew love enough in ſetting
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:57576:49"/>up ſuch an object, as man in the perſon of the Lord, Jeſus from all eternity in his heavenly man, as if he could not ſhew love enough, in eſpouſing in him all his heavenly race, that ſhould be produced out of him: ſuppoſe Chriſt, as he is deſcribed in <hi>Prov.</hi> 8. where he is ſaid to be <hi>by him and rejoycing alwaies before him,</hi> ſuppoſe (I ſay) that Chriſt had a race of men, and a ſeed that he had begotten, and brought forth from that glory in which he was in eternity, this had been a great deal of love in God thus to eſpouſe man, and to beautify and glorify man; but (<hi>I</hi> ſay) for the glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of this love the Lord projects, that this man, who was the object of this love, he ſhall come forth in a natural image, as it is ſaid in the 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15. <hi>Firſt that which is natural, and afterwards that that is ſpiritual:</hi> and therefore, he maketh firſt, <hi>Adam,</hi> an <hi>earthly man,</hi> he makes him firſt <hi>a living ſoul,</hi> but yet here was not ground rich enough, that is, it was not dark enough to ſet off the love, and glory of God.</p>
               <p>And therefore, this man at his man at his beſt, being then but an earthly peice though pure earth) here is a project for this love to go out further to man, in his fall, and therefore the divine counſel permits all that, ſuffers man to fall into the utmoſt extremities, into the worſt of circumſtances, that could poſſibly be; and then, from thence doth the Lord recover him, and brings him up, to the firſt image, as a paſſage to the ſecond and heavenly image; he is reſtored in principle in Chriſt, but not ſo reſtored as to reſt there, and yet (I fear) there are thouſands of profeſſors that reſt there, that are reſtored to no more then Chriſts active and legal obedience; and they account this the new birth, but it is not ſo; for all that reſtoring, even in Chriſt him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf,
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:57576:50"/>it is but to declare him to be a fitting ſacrifice, <hi>a Lamb without ſpot,</hi> and to furniſh the matter of that ſacrifice, and every ſaint hath ſomething of this ſpot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe lamb (as I may ſay) though not in perfection, he is not without ſpot as Chriſt, but he is without ſpot in Chriſt, not in himſelf, for if you examine the acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of the beſt men, and take a tryal of them, and weigh them, they cannot hold weight before the Lord, though a ſaint in his minde, hath a more noble principle, <hi>be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing renewed after the image of him, that created him.</hi> But if it were ſo in Chriſt, that he, at the very heighth of his legal righteouſneſſe was only thereby qualifyed and furniſhed to be a ſacrifice to his father, it is that which inſtructs us, that in all our attainments in that firſt image, we ſhould look upon it to be only given us, for a ſacrifice.</p>
               <p>There was you know ſeveral offerings under the law, ſome were but a pair of young pigeons, yet it was accepted, ſo that (I ſay) whether we have more or leſſe of that active righteouſneſſe in the force of our firſt life, and principle reſtored (this is a great ſhort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs in our knowledg, not to know that there is in Chriſt himſelf a firſt covenant-life, a firſt covenant-principle) this muſt all be laid down and parted with, Chriſt did ſo himſelf, and ſo muſt all his.</p>
               <p>And this is that, that the Lord is carrying on, through this life. we are dying daily, and offering up our bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies, and I pray, what is that body <hi>which is dead be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe of ſin,</hi> the Apoſtle ſpeaks of men that were in the body of the fleſh, therefore this body is the body of the firſt creation light, it is that image of God that was preſented in it's perfection, by Chriſt, in as great and abſolute a perfection as in the firſt <hi>Adam.</hi>
               </p>
               <pb n="91" facs="tcp:57576:50"/>
               <p> And it is reſtored in principle, in all that believe in Chriſt, there is ſomthing of that liſe, whereby they tend to a greater exactneſſe and perfection, then they can attain unto, but this body is dead, and all muſt be broken off from this husband, as in <hi>Rom.</hi> 7. you have it there very plainly declared, <hi>know ye not brethren for I ſpeak to them that know the law</hi> (ſays he) <hi>how that the law hath dominion over a man as long as he liveth,</hi> that is as long as the man lives his own life (for a believer is crucified with Chriſt, but Chriſt lives in him) what is the husband here? it is the law you will ſay, the law is not capable to be a mans husband, as it is only a doctrine, or as it is a form of words, what is that to be ones husband? Therefore you muſt conſider, herein, that it is Chriſt (mark ye) that is the husband even under the law, for he hath a firſt covenant wiſe, and firſt covenant children, he is a husband under the law, is it not ſaid, <hi>though I was a husband unto them, Ier.</hi> 31.32. I beſeech you accept of theſe hints, and weigh them.</p>
               <p>I deſire not to ſpeak my own words, and if I did not think, that there was that in theſe things which doth mainly import our ſouls, I durſt not ſpeak them; but if you conſider, you will find that there is a world of profeſſors, that have only relation to Chriſt as a firſt covenant Lord, and husband, for it is Chriſt that is the perſon in both, in law, and Goſpel.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Moſes</hi> was but a typical mediator, it was Chriſt that was the true Mediator.</p>
               <p>There is an appearance in which Chriſt comes forth, which is not to abide, but is to go away, as he ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaints his diſciples with the expedience of it then, yet he was a Bridegroom then, but he was a Bride<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>groom
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:57576:51"/>in the fleſh, and that covenant-relation was to be exchanged for a better covenant-relation, <hi>Rom.</hi> 7.4.</p>
               <p>Do you not ſee here, that Chriſt is the Bridegroom, his fleſh was ſhadowed out by the law, what do we mean by his fleſh? my beloved brethren let us wait upon the Lord for light in theſe things, there hath been a great deal of pudder about the fleſh of Chriſt, as if Chriſt had no body now: becauſe the Apoſtle to the Hebrews reflects on the days of his fleſh as paſt.</p>
               <p>Alas! this is not the meaning of Chriſt fleſh, for the fleſh properly, and the law and ſin, and death, all theſe are relative one to the other, ſo that the fleſh, as it is conſidered in us, is the free hold of ſin; now Chriſt, he comes in the fleſh, and he therein fulfils all right<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſſe, and ſo doth (as I may ſay) recover that ground which the firſt <hi>Adam</hi> had lo<gap reason="illegible: missing" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>t, ſin was entred upon the fleſh, Chriſt he comes and plants righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe in the fleſh (marke ye) it is but in the fleſh, the fleſh is that active ſate of firſt-covenant life, and righteouſneſs in conformity to the law and letter, which was the ſtate which was reſtored in Chriſt though loſt in <hi>Adam,</hi> and this is that which believers themſelves are brought forth into, in order to a paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage through it into the righteouſneſs of God, the firſt ſtone of which building is laid, in the diſſolution and paſſing away of this firſt ſtrength, this firſt activiry and power, that the creature finds himſelf inveſted withall, and in which he thinks himſelf a gallant peice.</p>
               <p>I ſay the firſt ſtone of this new building, is laid by the pulling down of all this, <hi>ye are dead to the law, that ye night be married to another, even to him that is rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed from the dead,</hi> there is our new husband, that is a
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:57576:51"/>believer hath now given up, as Chriſt did, when he gave up that firſt life and righteouſneſſe to his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. When he had done all, and the law could require no more from him, he had another piece of obedience which was a note above all the law, what was that? why he muſt be obedient unto death, as much, as if God had ſaid unto him, canſt thou now my ſon forgo all this glory, canſt thou ſtrip thy ſelf, canſt thou put it all off, canſt thou truſt me to raiſe thee again, and bring thee forth in another glory, in a heavenly image? I can, ſays he, there is none but Chriſt could do it, were it not for our captaine, we ſhould never have gone through, he was marryed (as I told you) unto the original glory of God, he was marryed to his head, and he having the preſence of eternal life with him, he is able to charge through theſe legions of devils, this land of death and dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, though it was that made him <hi>ſweat drops of blood,</hi> and cry out, <hi>my ſoul is ſorrowful unto death;</hi> yet he was ſo enabled, and ſupported, that through he goes, and had that glorious iſſue, that the Goſpel is the report of, this is one husband; now mark ye, he being raiſed from the dead walked a while with his diſciples upon the earth, about 40. days, then he aſcended, he was not in that glory where he expected to be, while he was on the earth, for he would not let <hi>Mary</hi> touch him, ſaying <hi>touch me not, for I am not yet aſcended to my fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,</hi> as who ſhould ſay, I am not yet, where I would be, nor where <hi>I</hi> ſhall be, <hi>I</hi> am not yet the object of that new converſe, which thou ſhalt have with me or at leaſt <hi>I</hi> am not yet manifeſt in it.</p>
               <p>Therefore (I ſay) his aſcending was, that he might marry our natures in his own perſon, unto his glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:57576:52"/>head, though he was marryed unto the father in eternity, yet not as <hi>the ſon of man</hi> on earth, but this was the marriage of the <hi>ſon of man</hi> on earth.</p>
               <p>And ſo he carryed up our nature, out of this ſtate of poverty, beggery, in ſin, death, yea out of legalor firſt covenant-righteouſneſſe into the glory of God, that is the third marriage, that I have been ſpeaking of wherein, you ſee how it differs from the firſt mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage.</p>
               <p>The firſt was the marriage of the ſon of man, in hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven unto the godhead, but this is the marriage of the ſon of man on earth unto the <hi>ſon of man in heaven,</hi> that is clear by our Saviour his own ſtating of it (let us not ſlight that) for he ſays, <hi>before Abraham was. I am,</hi> this glory, is to be the covering, the clothing to the ſon of man, on earth, this is the wedding from which he comes.</p>
               <p>You poſſibly will ſay, why did not Chriſt come all this time, hath this wedding laſted this 16. 1700. years? my brethren, our Lord Jeſus Chriſt is preſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted as our head, ſo that Chriſt was married as a pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lique perſon, and we muſt all follow to this wedding, this hath been the work ever ſince, through all times and ages; from Chriſts aſſention, it hath been (I ſay) the preparation of the Bride the lambs wife, for this fourth and laſt marriage Chriſts 3d marriage, <hi>the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens muſt receive until the reſtitution of all things, till his Bride be ready.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And all the ſaints have been haſtening out of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, out of his fleſhly fallible ſtate and image, into the reſurrection life, they have been haſtning by a miſtical death; this is the work of all ages ſince Chriſt, to prepare the Bride (that is ſuch a number of men and women as God hath fore known, in his eternal counſel,
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:57576:52"/>that are to come up ſucceſſively upon the ſtage of this world, in their generations and times, to be the wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes of our Lord, and of his death, his ſufferings are to be fulfilled in them, and ſo is his life to be manifeſted in them (as the dyings of Jeſus, ſo his life) this hath been his work ſince his a ſcention, and when his num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber is eompleated, then will the Lord reveal himſelf from heaven in our perſons, in that glory, which our natures have been inveſted with from his aſcention; then will Chriſt and his bride, the lamb and the lambs wiſe, plant, and model the world, and they will have a new ſeed after that which ſhall be born, in Chriſts own image (as <hi>Adam</hi> is ſaid to beget a <hi>ſon in his own image</hi>) which will be the new race of men and women after this glorious marriage.</p>
               <p>For Chriſt will have generations of ſaints, that ſhall be brought forth unto him in his kingdom, in another glory, then we have known all this time; Thus I have been carryed, whether I would not, for what I deſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to ſpeak, I am not come to, I ſhould have ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed you by the example and pattern of his wedding on Chriſts part, the glory of his marriage, and I ſhould have come to the application, but I muſt take another time for this.</p>

               <p>YOu ſee, though I am off from my former text, yet not from my ſubject, this text benig of a kin to it, and bordering upon it, and having many things in my mind upon it, though not digeſted into ſuch a method, as more leiſure and time might have afforded: I ſhall abruptly preſent to you the 2. heads, upon which we ſhall ſpend this opportunity, without more curious ſurvey of the text, or context, and briefly they are.</p>
               <p n="1">1. That bleſſed and glorious hope, which is laid up for the Saints, at Chriſts appearing, and 2d. the evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of it.</p>
               <p>Theſe are the two things that I ſhall pick out of theſe words, the hope is, that we ſhall be like Chriſt when he appears, the evidence of this hope, is, that we <hi>ſhall ſee him, as he is,</hi> for the hope it ſelf, you ſee, it concerns us, our perſons, and our ſpirits.</p>
               <p>And that is the immediate and great concern and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectation of believers, in Chriſts glorious kingdom, and at his glorious appearing, the change that ſhall be brought upon our ſelves, the glorious change that ſhall be brought upon all things, (<hi>for he that ſits upon the throne</hi> (ſays) <hi>behold I make all things new</hi>) is to begin firſt upon us, it is to begin upon the Saints and when they are changed not only will all things be
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:57576:53"/>changed to them, but all things ſhall be changed with them, though not preſently, yet in due courſe and order, for the Apoſtle ſays that <hi>the whole creation grones and travels in pain, expecting to be delivered into the glorious liberty of the ſons of God;</hi> they are to be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered into our liberty, and the Goſpel throughout, in all the priviledges both of grace and glory (in both ſtates of the kingdom, both that of grace, and of glory (the militant, and the triumphant ſtate) do hold forth firſt fruits, that ſhall be firſt viſited and firſt ſaved, and then the Lump and body, firſt the root, and then the branches, and I do the rather put a note upon this, becauſe we are apt to be carried forth into other contemplations and expectations of the change of times, the change of kingdoms, common-wealths, Churches, and overlook the fundamental change, this head change, this right change which begins in the perſons of Saints, of believers themſelves, which may be called the beginning of changes, as we read of the <hi>beginning of revenges,</hi> in <hi>Deuteronòmy,</hi> or the head revenge of the enemy, ſo this is the head of change, and in vain do we look for a happineſſe to come unto us, by the change of our circumſtances, and of our con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions, if there be not this Radical, this fundamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal change in our perſons, and ſpirits. Now this change, I ſhall firſt preſent it to you in the ſubſtance of it, and then ſhall conſider the arguments, the illuſtrating ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments, in the text, and in the context. Firſt the ſubſtance of this change, into a likeneſſe of Chriſt, when he ſhall appear, we ſhall be like him, the like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe unto Chriſt is that which cannot but ſpeak for it ſelf, and commend it ſelf ſufficiently to our deſires, can there be any better thing then to be like Chriſt? can
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:57576:54"/>there be a greater thing then to be like Chriſt? Let us but conſider who, and what he is, he is the likeneſſe of God, the <hi>brightneſs of his glory, the character of his perſon,</hi> in whom god hath drawn forth himſelf, to the life, he is the image, he is the glory of God, there is not any excellency in God but it is diſplayed in our Lord Jeſus, moſt beautifully; moſt divinely, moſt ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantagiouſly; and therefore it may well be a hope that may bow the vaſteſt deſires, and fill and ſatisfy the moſt enlarged hearts and expectations, ſurely if there be ſo much beauty in this firſt creation, in this natural image, which is but the firſt draught, but the rude lineaments (as I may ſay) of that glorious image of God, then what muſt there be in the very life-image it ſelf: if the ſhadow be ſo beautiful, on what is the perſon!</p>
               <p>As it is ſaid, he that <hi>made the eye, ſhall be not ſee,</hi> ſo <hi>(I may ſay)</hi> in this caſe, he that hath by a ſhadowy relation that he hath given the creature, put ſo much beauty upon it (as in the firſt creation before it was marred by ſin, which had a great deal of beauty in it) hath he not a choicer beauty, hath he parted with any thing from himſelf, and hath he not retayned better things with himſelf?</p>
               <p>But I ſhall not go on to expatiate upon this, for it would quickly engulph us, and take up all our time, but that which I would further ſay, is this, and it will ariſe out of the arguments of the text, which will ſhew us the greatneſſe of this glory, we wait (for the glory of this image which we ſhall be conformed unto) there are ſeveral arguments in the text, and in the context <hi>v.</hi> 1. <hi>Behold what manner of love,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>And it doth not yet appear,</hi> &amp;c. The firſt ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:57576:54"/>is the preſent non-appearance of this-life, of this glory, ſome philoſophy makes privation a prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple, and ſo here in the text; This non-appearance, which is in a ſort a privation, is a principle, or a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtration of the glory of our future hope and expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctation: <hi>It doth not yet appear;</hi> now when the Apoſtle ſays it doth not et appear, you muſt not take him, as ſpeaking of a ſaint, when he is at the worſt only (when he is at and under in his ſpirit) but you muſt take him as ſpeaking to (or taking in within the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent, or compaſſe of his affirmation) the beſt ſtate that ever any ſaint did appear in, that it was rather a non appearance then a proper appearance of this glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, it doth not yet appear, take it from <hi>Adam,</hi> and all the firſt creation-glory, take it from <hi>Abraham,</hi> and all the new creation-glory that ever yet appeared, it is a non-appearance, it is a hyding rather then a diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>playing of this glory, <hi>it doth not yet appear.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>None of the ſaints in their attainments in their moſt lively and raiſed apprehentions, or actings ever did, or could give any tollerable account of this glory; I ſhall make forth to you my meaning by a Scripture reſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blance, the preſent ſtate of the ſaints is but as the ſtate of moſt rich and beautiful flowers in the ſeed, or of a moſt flouriſhing and fruitful tree in the kernel; you know what the Apoſtle ſays in the 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15.36. and ſo on.</p>
               <p>As much as this, that the natural body, take it in a ſaint himſelf that hath the higheſt communications of God, it is but the ſeed of the ſpiritual body, and of the true appearance into which he ſhall break forth, and ſo our Saviour calls himſelf in that preſent ſtate of his in the fleſh, in <hi>Job.</hi> 12.24. a ſingle ſeed.</p>
               <pb n="100" facs="tcp:57576:55"/>
               <p> In all his miniſtries and miracles he calls himſelf but a ſingle ſeed; now what may we learn from this; why that the preſent ſtate of a Chriſtian bears no greater proportion to the future, it bears no greater ſimili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude, and reſemblance of the future, then a ſeed, or a ſingle grain, or kernel doth of the flower, the plant, the tree, the fruit.</p>
               <p>There are three things in a ſeed which do forbid it to glory, firſt, it is a narrow, contracted thing, it is a dark thing, and confuſed; it is alſo a dead thing, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept it fall into the earth, it abides alone. I ſhall ſpeak of theſe three a little; that ſo we may from the diſad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantages of the preſent ſtate, be a little enlightned into the glory of our future and enlarged hope.</p>
               <p n="1">1. A ſeed is a contracted thing, what is a kernel to a tree, a poor little narrow thing, you know what our Saviour ſays, of the muſtard ſeed, <hi>that it is the leaſt of all ſeeds,</hi> but the true body of that ſeed (when it is grown up) the birds may reſt in the branches of it; ſo are we in the preſent ſtate, narrow, and contracted, Oh! we have neither room for God, nor room for one another in our hearts, we are ſuch pittiful poor narrow contracted things, as ſingle ſeeds abiding a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone.</p>
               <p>I have lately been thinking touching the reſurrecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, how we in the preſent ſtate do eſpouſe (mark ye) but a few duſts of the earth, as our peculiar bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies, and we are ſeperated and divided from all others, as well as from the globe, the Maſſe, and body of the earth; and this body, we not only live in, but live to it, all our care and concerns is for it, and let all the earth be miſerable if we can be happy.</p>
               <p>This is the pittiful narrowneſſe and contractedneſſe
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:57576:55"/>of man in the preſent ſtate, and although the ſeed of God, which is caſt into us, is (as the Lord ſays of his people) a <hi>noble vine,</hi> a noble ſeed, and is witneſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing, and teſtifying in us, of a greater largeneſs and breathing after it, yet we cannot break from our pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, but here we are confyned and ſhut up in the nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row bounds of ſelf, yea ſhut up againſt God, and we would be content to be a vail upon God, though he did looſe his glory thereby.</p>
               <p>Oh! there is this pitiful narrowneſs, in this preſent ſtate, but when the body is ſown in the earth, then it mingles and incorporates with it's mother earth, into the duſt of the whole creation, then it marries them all, ſo will it be in our riſen ſtate: oh! then there will no more be a particular concern, a particular life, a par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular glory, but we ſhall have the body in communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, be in fellowſhip with all our fellow-members; we ſhall ſtand in one body, in one joy, with our head, and all our fellow members, as you ſee in a ſeed of corn, when it hath dyed in the earth, it comes up in an ear of corn, wherein there are many ſeeds, 20.30. a hundred fold, living in fellowſhip together.</p>
               <p>Secondly, a ſeed is a dark thing, dark, and confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, there is in a ſeed radically, vertually the tree, the plant, the flower in that poor little ſeed, but if you will go to finde out the arms of this tree, it is not the moſt skilful Anatomiſt that can finde them out, but there they lye wrapt up together in a dark ſtate not explicate, not brought forth, ſo is it in the preſent ſtate of the ſaints.</p>
               <p>There is heaven, yea what do we ſay heaven, there is God, and Chriſt, and the ſpirit yea there are all the Angels of God, there is all the train, all the Reti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue,
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:57576:56"/>all the gory of heaven, in every ſaint, ſo as that they do dwell mutually in one another, and every ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit is a houſe, and habitation for all bleſſed ſpirits, and all graces, all vertues, all excellencies; they ſhall diſplay themſelves gloriouſly even out of this ſeed, but at the preſent they are only here in a confuſed maſſe, nay a maſſe I may not call it, they are but in a principle not brought forth. We have ſometimes hints, notions, apprehenſions of great glory, but where are the integral parts that ſhould make this an entire piece: here is a glimps, a glance, and eye, a little finger, as it is ſaid of one of the twinns that put forth his hand and drew it back (in the caſe of <hi>Zarez,</hi> and <hi>Pharez.</hi>) So there is a putting forth of the hand, but alas the body is yet in the dark, and keeps behind all thoſe glorious parts, they are but in ſeed, yea</p>
               <p n="3">3ly, As ſeed is not only dark and confuſed, but it is dead as our Saviour ſays, and we all know by experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence. You may take that ſeed, which will ſow a whole field, and bring forth a plentiful harveſt, you may lay it up in your garners, years, and yet you have not one ſeed more at the years end, then when you laid it up; for alas! the ſeed is a dead thing, unleſſe it falls into the earth, as our Saviour ſays, ſo are we, <hi>we are dead,</hi> as the Apoſtle ſays, <hi>and our life is hid with Chriſt in God.</hi> There is the earth, we muſt fall into, there is our mother earth, our principle with which we muſt unite, muſt be in union with it, by a miſtical death; you know that this natural death is but an ordinance to ſerve in the knowledge and doctrine of this myſtical death unto us, it was ordained for this end unto be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers, it came in originally by ſin, yet being come in, God makes uſe of it for this ſervice, to repreſent to
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:57576:56"/>our eyes and ſences, that we muſt thus dye out of our ſelves, as the body dyes into its original, that ſo it may be in union with the fulneſſe of the whole earth: So we muſt dye out of our particulars into our own ſource or principle: <hi>the new Jeruſalem that is from a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove,</hi> that ſpirit of which we are, from whence we were taken: as <hi>Adams</hi> body was taken from the earth, ſo we are taken from a divine ground, and into that muſt we dye and fall, that ſo (I ſay) we may be in uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on &amp; in fellowſhip with the fulneſs of that principle. I might obſerve other things from the ſeed, as being courſe in it's appearance, a courſe covering. all of you know that the husk of a ſeed is but a courſe thing, ſo is the preſent form and appearance of the ſaints; I do not ſpeak of the bodily appearance only, though that is but a courſe thing in compariſon of the glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous body that we ſhall have, when Chriſt appears: But the body of our works, and righteouſneſſe, and all our actings as we are profeſſors or ſaints, it is but a courſe thing in compariſon, you know there is, if you take off the husk of a kernel there is a fine white kernel within, ſo I ſay there is a pure thing, lyes un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der a dark, and courſe covering in us, <hi>it doth not yet appear</hi> that is the firſt argument.</p>
               <p>The Second argument, of the glory of this ſtate, that we look for, is from theſe words, <hi>now are we the Sons of God,</hi> compared with the firſt words of the 1ſt vers. <hi>behold what manner of love hath the father beſtowed upon as, that we ſhould be called the ſons of God;</hi> my argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment from hence is this, if we are the <hi>ſons of God,</hi> that doth import a greater glory, then we indeed can con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive, for it doth import a ſimilitude unto God, and a bearing his image, as the ſon of a man bears the image
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:57576:57"/>of his father, and is like unto his father; and the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle in that <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.17. builds very high upon this bottom, upon this foundation, <hi>If children, then heyres heyres of God,</hi> and <hi>joint-heyres with Chriſt, that if we ſuffer together, we ſhould be alſo glorifyed too ether;</hi> and ſo he goes on, he builds all this upon this foundation that we are children, that we are ſons: you know that the father doth communicate not only his worldly ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, not only his goods, his riches, his inheritance, but his life, his ſpirit and his nature, unto his children; now if you would but take in the ſtrength of this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration, we muſt (I ſay) conſider the 1ſt vers, <hi>behold what manner of love,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Love,</hi> you know is the principle of propagation in the creature, and ſo is love in God, and it is ſuch a kinde of love, this propagating love it doth intend the beſtowing of the deareſt life and joy to the begotten, we are ſaid to be <hi>born of the will of God.</hi> Now you know that every mans will is called his pleaſure, becauſe indeed the will is the very ſubject and ſource of all pleaſure, and in all compariſon be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the underſtanding and the will; they agree in this, that the underſtanding doth form and draw (as I may ſay) the lineaments of truth, But the will gives the life, touches the life of intellectual creatures, is the pleaſure of their will in the draught of their un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtandings; ſo that the ſaints, as born of the will of God, are the very pleaſure of God, they are the very love of God, they are the breath of this love, the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct of his love, upon which he doth deſigne to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>play all the lovelyneſs that is in himſelf; and therefore now, what think you? hath the love of god given that glorious account of it ſelf in the preſent ſtate of the ſaints? is this all the love which God hath to ſhed
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:57576:57"/>down upon us? this that we experience in this pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent ſtate? why! if God loves he will love like himſelf, and the effects of this love ſhall reſemble that great love, which is the author of it, and the fountain of it, it muſt reſemble it, it is ſaid, that they ſhall ſay, <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold how he hath loved them,</hi> men and Angels ſhall ſay ſo, <hi>behold how he hath loved them,</hi> God will write forth his love in a greater character, and in a fairer letter, then yet it hath been read in, nay then yet it hath been conceived by any ſaint; the prophet tells us, <hi>no eye be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides thee, hath ſeen, or conceived the things, that he hath prepared for them, that love God,</hi> Eſay. 64. I may from hence glide very aptly into the evidence of this hope, though there are ſeveral other arguments of the greatneſſe of it: I now come to the evidence of it, the evidence lyes partly in what God hath done, and partly in what he hath declared himſelf, that he will do. Firſt, in what God hath done, God hath al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready (you ſee) loved us, and he tels us in the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets with an everlaſting love, and that everlaſting love is not only to everlaſting, but was from everlaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; now there is more in this, then you are aware of, God hath ſet up this glory with himſelf (this glory in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to which he will bring forth the ſaints, he hath ſet it up with himſelf) before the world was, he hath ſet it up in Chriſt let me tell you, there is nothing leſſe then eternal life, that God thinks worthy of his people, or that they are to account an intereſt: Therefore now, if the things we hope for, be eternal things, then they were before the world was: <hi>in hope of eternal life, which God that cannot lye, promiſed before the world began,</hi> yea he not only promiſed it, but he did exhibit it in the perſon of our Lord Jeſus, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5. We wait to <hi>be clo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thed
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:57576:58"/>upon with our houſe from heaven the building of God, eternal in the heavens,</hi> this eternal habitation is that that <hi>Job</hi> ſpeaks of, <hi>he ſhall know his habitation and not ſin:</hi> This eternal fair record of our perſons, and of our life in Chriſt, is that which was <hi>by him,</hi> when he made the world, as in <hi>Prov,</hi> 8. Let me tell you, this ſtate of ours, this contracted dead ſtate, which we are in at this preſent time (which is as the rude draught of that ſuture ſtate that we expect (why this ſtate of ours and this ſeed) was comprehended in that ſtate, in glory above, and did flow, as it were from that ſtate, grew from that glorious plant and tree; it deſcended by cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation into this ſtate of nature that here it might dye, and might riſe again through a miſtical death into it's firſt ſtate, for Chriſt that is our pattern hath declared the divine proceſſe of this myſtery.</p>
               <p>Chriſt tells us, that he was in <hi>the boſome of the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther</hi> before he came into the womb of the virgin, and while he was here on earth, he had his apartment in glory: his rooms, his Lodgings, in heaven, nay the whole was his, he was the ſon of man in heaven, though he did come forth from that ſtate into this poor narrow thing, the <hi>ſon of man</hi> on earth, yet he had his relation to that ſtill, therefore he ſays, <hi>glorify me with that glory that I had with thee before the world began,</hi> this is the no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleneſſe of a Chriſtians relation, and that conſiſts in two thins eſpecially.</p>
               <p>The one is, that the whole work is tranſacted in the perſon of Chriſt, we are ſaved in him, circumciſed, raiſed in him, and the other is, that there is the pattern in the mount of all that we ſhall be, that is eternally exiſtent with God, in which he doth behold all his works, his very laſt and concluding ſcene, and that is
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:57576:58"/>the righteouſneſſe that ſuſtains him, under all the riskes and the adventures that his works do run through, in this world, and it is a great ground of hope to the ſaints, that they deſcend from ſuch a ſtate. if you could ſuppoſe a ſpring in the city, that was as high as the higheſt tower, though it might fall as low, as the loweſt part of the ground of the whole city, yet it would riſe again as high as the place, from whence it comes, and ſo (I ſay) this is a great confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matiou unto us, that we ſhall arrive at ſuch a pitch, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe we ſet forth from ſuch a glory. Let others call this a notion, if they will, I am ſure. the Scripture gives ground for it, I will be bold to ſay, that all that glory, as it is in heaven above, ſo it is likewiſe ſhut up in narrow bounds in that principle of regeneration, that is in the heart of a ſaint; theſe heavens, as they lye in the ſpirit, and perſon of our Lord Jeſus, ſo do they in the principle of regeneration, of ſaith and love, as it is in Chriſt Jeſus: <hi>faith and love</hi> you muſt not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand to be only of Chriſt efficiently, but to be in Chriſt ſubjectively, our graces would never endure, nor keep ſweet, if they were not kept in Chriſt, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe we derive our ſelves from thoſe dear bowels of the father; when he brought forth Chriſt who is the eternal ſon of god, he brought forth his whole body in him, all his members were with him, and all the glory that ever they ſhall have, was put upon them there, in that pattern in the mount.</p>
               <p>The Second evidence of it, is, The intereſt of our Lord Jeſus in this, whoſe children, whoſe branches, whoſe ſeed we are, <hi>when he ſhall appear, we ſhall be like him,</hi> if ſo be that ſuch poor inconſiderable things, as we might alwaies be whelmed under a buſhel; is
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:57576:59"/>Chriſt ſo inconſiderable think you, ſhall not he be ſet on a Candleſtick, ſhall he not have his time to appear</p>
               <p>Till we appear with Chriſt, Chriſt will not be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleatly glorifyed, and when Chriſt doth appear, we cannot but appear with him, why ſo? becauſe as we are called in a body ſo is Chriſt called in a body too: Chriſt cannot avoid being afflicted in our afflictions, I tell you there is no weather-glaſſe that ſhews changes in the air, as Chriſts glorifyed perſon ſhews all the changes that befals his members, and ſo they repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent his glorifyed perſon, as in a glaſſe, and there ill be ſpots in this moon, till the ſaints are glorify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with him; therefore it is Chriſts intereſt the glory of the ſaints, <hi>when he ſhall come to be glorifyed in his ſaints, and admired in all that believe not,</hi> by them, but <hi>in them,</hi> 2 Thes. 1.</p>
               <p>Therefore let this be the comfort of poor ſaints that travel under a load of corruption, a body of ſin, and of death, of it ſhall not always be ſo with the ſons of God, they ſhall not always be ſo kept, it ſhall not always be ſo with the ſon of God, with the ſon of righteouſneſs, he ſhall not always be hid with a cloud; no, no, he hath his time to appear, <hi>the great and only Potentate, king of kings, and Lord of Lords,</hi> he muſt ſhew this great ſight, and he will ſhew it in it's ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed time; 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 6.15. and laſtly, now to ſhew you a little of the power by which it ſhall be done, which poſſibly will not get an eaſy entrance into our belief (what is the reaſon we ſtick at the believing of things, but becauſe we do not credit the power by which it ſhall be done) it ſhall be by Chriſts appearing. It is no more but for Chriſt to look forth and to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent himſelf, and to ſhew himſelf, and the work is
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:57576:59"/>done, we may truly ſay, <hi>let God ariſe, and his enemies ſhall be ſcattered;</hi> you ſee every day, how that cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pion, the ſun comes out of his quarters as a bridgroom out of his chamber, and how he no ſooner ſets forth, but all darkneſſe flyes before him. Oh! it is not the ſtouteſt of enemies, that thou haſt, nor that the Church hath, can bear the preſence, and the looking forth of the Lord Jeſus, but they will preſently cry, <hi>hide us from the face of him, that ſits upon the throne, and from the preſence of the lamb;</hi> my brethren, this glory in which Chriſt ſhall appear, if you do but conſider it, that the ſtate in which he was upon the earth was but as the ſeed, and in that firſt appearance bore no greater a proportion to the glory of his perſon, and his ſpirit now in the 2d appearance then a ſed, a little dark ſed, doth unto it's plant or tree.</p>
               <p>Do not think your Saviour will be ſeen by you, as in the days of his fleſh, no he will come in <hi>the glory of his father,</hi> what do you think your Saviour to be, is he not God as well as man, he will come in the demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtration of his Godhead, and what ſhall be hard or un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible unto <hi>Almightineſs</hi> it ſelf, <hi>he ſpake the word, and they were created.</hi> Thus will <hi>God plant the heavens, and lay the foundations of the new earth,</hi> even by the word that he hath put into the mouths of his poor witneſſes in ſackcloath, when he ſhall appear to back this teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony, Oh! how will this living word back this teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony, and how will it kindle and ſet on fire, the foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dations of the mountains: and whatever doth cover this glory? <hi>when the Lord gave the word, great was the company that publiſhed it,</hi> not only the Angels, but eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry creature ſhall take the word and publiſh it, and tranſmit it to the very end of the world: I will give
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:57576:60"/>you but a little demonſtration of it, and that is from all your experience, look what power the hitherto appearances of Chriſt have had in and upon the world, upon the ſaints in the world, Chriſt dwelling in their hearts by faith, what great things hath it done, ſee what thoſe worthies did by faith in <hi>Heb.</hi> 11. <hi>By faith</hi> Enoch <hi>was tranſlated, through faith they ſubdued king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms, wrought righteouſneſſe, ſtopped the mouths of lyons, quenched the violence of the fire, women received their dead raiſed to life again,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p>Now faith, you know is but ſeeing at a diſtance, but when Chriſt ſhall draw near, when he ſhall hold forth himſelf immediatly to the ſoul, oh! what a glorious power ſhall we be ſencible of from thence: ſo if we ſhould reflect upon revelations what great things have revelations done: ye know when <hi>Paul</hi> was by the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velation of the Lord, as he ſays 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12.3. taken up I <hi>knew a man in Chriſt (ſays he,)</hi> he was not <hi>ſencible</hi> whether he was in the body or not, as much as to ſay, I was not concern'd about that, now, this is all, that I would ſay unto you, I would have you to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand me aright, it is not only a bodily ſight of Chriſt that I drive at, though that ſhall alſo be, and the bodily eye ſhall be able to take in the glory of his body and perſon.</p>
               <p>But there is an intellectual ſight of Chriſt, taking him in, by ſpiritual ſences, Chriſt is God, as well as man, and this is that I would only ſay, that the ſight of Chriſt is the power, whereby we are changed into the ſimilitude of Chriſt, by a true ſight of him in the ſpirit, in the glory of his ſpiritual perſon, this is that which will transform and change us: ſo that we are changed after a divine manner, I ſay it is not by any
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:57576:60"/>methods, or ways of the creatures acting, I cannot put you into a way, and tell you of ſuch a proceſs as your Chymiſts do, that you muſt proceed thus and thus, no but I ſay it is his exhibitting of himſelf, in a clear light; upon the ſoul, enables it to copy him forth, as I may ſay; and to be brought forth into the ſame ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>militude.</p>

                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe,</hi> firſt, let us bear up under our preſent unlikeneſs unto Chriſt. truly the preſent unlikeneſs is made ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny times more unlike by temptations, which God ſends upon his people, and by deſertion, as if they were not low enough by the general common and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant attendants of the fall, God ſo diſpences his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, many times, as to fall into deeps, and darkneſs, that they have no ſence of what they were, or of what they are, or of what they ſhall be, bear up under theſe for there is a day of brightning promiſed.</p>
               <p>And my ſecond word is this, it is Chriſts work and not yours, you are paſſive in it, and under it, pray what do the heavens do to their own enlightning, but lye under the beames of the ſun, when the ſun (which knows his time) ariſeth, and comes forth into the fir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mament. Let this comfort poor ſouls that are concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for holyneſs, that are concern'd for the image of God, and likeneſs unto Chriſt. Let it comfort us for the Church, and for the whole creation, all which have promiſes: firſt, the <hi>firſt fruits</hi> the Church firſt, and then the world, firſt the <hi>dead in Chriſt</hi> are to ariſe, <hi>e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very one in his order:</hi> now I ſay, that is our hope, and our hope is laid upon our Lord Jeſus, and upon his appearing, and therefore do not diſpond, do not ſay, how ſhall this be done? conſider but the word in <hi>Phil.</hi> 3. <hi>chap. According to the power whereby he is able to ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:57576:61"/>all things to himſelf,</hi> I tell yon there is no ſuch power in matter, or in body as there is in ſpirit, the Lord Jeſus Chriſt he changes us after a ſpiritual man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, we are changed by the ſpirit of the Lord, that ſpirit which works in an inſtant, therefore it is ſaid <hi>in a moment,</hi> or in the <hi>twinkling of an eye.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>My ſecond Uſe is this, Oh! travel, travel in the knowledg of Chriſt, and in the diſcoveries of Chriſt, oh! wait to know Chriſt, and to have him open'd and revealed to you in the Scriptures, and by the ſpirit in all the means you are under, I ſay wait for this, when <hi>we ſhall ſee him, as be is, we ſhall be like him;</hi> Oh! it is nothing but the hiding of Chriſts glory from us, that makes us to partake ſo little of his glory, <hi>becauſe I live, ye ſhall live alſo,</hi> the very ſight of his life will im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port life unto us, ſo the ſight of his glory will put glory upon us, <hi>for when he ſhall appear, we ſhall appear with him in glory.</hi>

               <p>I Have been long upon theſe words, but the ſubject is very copious, which will excuſe me, my aim in firſt pitching upon them, was, both to acquaint my ſelf, and you (I ſay that we might all of us be acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted from the Lord, and from his ſpirit amongſt us) with that preparation that becomes us for the Lords appearing: to this end, I have ſpent much of my time in holding forth to you, the grounds of my expectati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Lords coming to be neer; very neer; begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with the ſignes which our Saviour himſelf gives us of his day: in handling of which I was caſt upon that phraſe <hi>of the days of the ſon of man,</hi> which I endeavou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to clear up unto you, that they did hold forth a tract of time, from the end of the beaſts term which we meet with in <hi>Rev.</hi> 13. (where we fynd it preciſely, limitted within the ſpace of 42 months) unto the <hi>com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing down of the new Jeruſalem,</hi> and Chriſts glorious ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance; and having diſpatch't that I came to the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication, and the laſt time, I ſpent the whole in an uſe of exhortation, to watching, to watch for the Lords coming, thinking to have gone on, with other duties, that this ſeaſon calls for.</p>
               <pb n="114" facs="tcp:57576:62"/>
               <p> But it hath been caſt into my thoughts ſince I was here, that there may remain ſome doubts touching the times, and I may be thought too forward and early a reckoner, and that chiefly upon the account of the Vyals, which many, very ſerious and enquiring ſouls (many that are very much enlightned in the works of God in this day, and have great hopes for the kingdom of Chriſt, and do wait heartily for re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption in <hi>Jeruſalem</hi>) yet cannot get over the ſtumbling block of the Vyals, thinking they are not yet poured out: whereas I have intimated often, that we are under the 6th Vyal, and have been ſo long; Therefore, though it may ſeem to be a great under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taking to remove this obſtrnction, and to give ſatisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction in this point, and I cannot ſay, that I have ſo prepared my ſelf for it, that I can promiſe this will be the fruit of it, yet I am willing to appear, though in weakneſſe, and hold forth that light which I have for this thing, that the Vyals, moſt of them are pou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red forth; I ſhall firſt give you my grounds for this and then I ſhall anſwer an objection or two, that are come to my knowledge againſt it, and ſo we ſhall go on afterwards with one application.</p>
               <p>Now in diſcerning this point (as indeed in diſcern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing all prophetical myſteries) there are two rules, that do exceedingly avail to the guiding of us in fynding out the minde of God in prophetical truths: and the firſt is this, to look to the type, and compare the type, and the antitype together, and the ſecond is, to compare the works of God in the world with his word, for theſe works of God are the comment upon his word, and the beſt comment that we can have: Now for the firſt, I would premiſe this, that there is not any thing
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:57576:62"/>in the new Teſtament, not any period of time, nor any ſcene that concerns us Chriſtian gentiles, but there is the prototype, the reſemblance of it, in the antient Church of the Jews; theſe times of the new Teſtament, are called <hi>the fulneſſe of times,</hi> they are the times of the fulfilling of prophecies; prophecy, though not as to fulfilling, yet as to delivery, was compleated and made up in the times of the old Teſtament, and therefore it is ſaid <hi>the prophets prophecyed until John,</hi> and our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our, when he began his miniſtry, ſays <hi>the time is ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filled,</hi> now then to the point in hand, what are the types of the Vyals.</p>
               <p>We do finde that expoſitors have not amiſs paralel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led theſe Vyals with the judgments that God did ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecute upon <hi>Egypt,</hi> when he brought forth <hi>Iſrael,</hi> for they are a manifeſt alluſion unto thoſe judgments, as you may ſee, if you do compare them, though they do not correſpond in point of number, yet they are called plagues, here is the ſcab as was in <hi>Egypt,</hi> as when <hi>Moſes</hi> threw up the duſt into the air, ſo it is in the firſt Vyal, there is a ſcab, and a ſore upon thoſe that worſhiped the beaſt: then another plague was upon the rivers and fountains, as here in the Vyals, the 3d Vyal turns the <hi>rivers into blood, and there was darkneſſe over the land of Egypt:</hi> ſo under the 5th Vyal the kingdom of the beaſt is <hi>darkned,</hi> ſo that I ſay, there is a warrantable ground for an alluſion of the Vyals to the plagues in <hi>Egypt,</hi> but yet withall <hi>I</hi> ſay the allu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion is not only unto the plagues of <hi>Egypt.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>For the Vyals are poured forth by the witneſſes, and we ſhall finde that there is an alluſion to 3 ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral <hi>pairs,</hi> all in that viſion of the witneſſes (or that doctrine of the witneſſes, as you may call it,
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:57576:63"/>if you will, <hi>Revel.</hi> 11. there is (I ſay) an alluſion to three pair of witneſſes, the firſt pair is <hi>Moſes</hi> and <hi>Aa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ron, Elijah</hi> and <hi>Eliſha</hi> the ſecond, and <hi>Joſhua</hi> and <hi>Ze<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rubbabel</hi> the third pair, and as they were called two witneſſes ſo they did fulfil their teſtimony in 2 parts, there was 2 parts of their witneſs, and two ſeaſons of the fulfilling thereof, the firſt part was in a time of ſuffering before they were eſcaped from under their ſuffering-ſtate, that was their firſt part; but in the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond part, they were upon the upper ground, they were (as I may ſay) the heyrs apparent of a king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, and an intereſt which was upon the riſing hand; I ſhall ſhew this to you clearly in all the three.</p>
               <p>Firſt, you know that <hi>Moſes</hi> and <hi>Aaron</hi> before they leſt <hi>Egypt</hi> (while <hi>Iſrael</hi> was under the yoak) they did pour out ſeveral plagues upon <hi>Egypt,</hi> but this was not all the work they had to do, there was the greateſt plague of all was powred out afterwards, when they were eſcaped ont of <hi>Egipt,</hi> at the red-ſea, there was the deſtruction of <hi>Pharaoh</hi> and all his hoſts.</p>
               <p>And <hi>Joſhua</hi> who was indeed for a ſupply unto <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes,</hi> when <hi>Moſes</hi> was taken off, to carry on and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleat the work, he led <hi>Iſrael</hi> into <hi>Canaan,</hi> and gave them that land: ſo that he did enter upon the labours of <hi>Moſes,</hi> and he knew the work, there is the firſt pair, and from the time of the red-ſea, <hi>Iſrael</hi> was a prevailing in tereſt, untill they were ſettled in <hi>Cana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an:</hi> ſo likewiſe, you may ſee in the ſecond pair, <hi>Eli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jah</hi> was a man of contention all his days and fled for his life, yet before his death, he had power to reſtrain the heavens, that <hi>they ſhould not rain, and he ſlayes the Prophets of Baal,</hi> I might ſhew you how that <hi>Ahab,</hi> and <hi>Jezabel</hi> and her prophets were exceeding apt
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:57576:63"/>types of the <hi>Beaſt,</hi> the falſe <hi>Prophet,</hi> and the <hi>whore,</hi> under the times of the new teſtament, as <hi>Elijah</hi> was a type of the witneſſes.</p>
               <p>Now <hi>Eliſha</hi> comes with a double portion of <hi>Elijahs</hi> ſpirit, he anoints <hi>John,</hi> and brings down the houſe of <hi>Ahab,</hi> and he perfects the work of <hi>Elijah</hi> in the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of the kingdom, <hi>Elijah</hi> repreſents the time of the witneſſes under their perſecution, and his aſcention was a type of the aſcention of the witneſſes, theſe are the ſecond pair.</p>
               <p>But the laſt pair is <hi>Joſhua,</hi> and <hi>Zerubbabel, Joſhua</hi> he was clothed with <hi>filthy garments</hi> as were the wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes that <hi>prophecyed in ſackcloth, Zach.</hi> 33. <hi>Joſhua</hi> was the prieſt, the high prieſt and <hi>Zerubbabel,</hi> he was the Prince, the civel ruler. Now you know, that it is ſaid in the <hi>Revelation</hi> that <hi>he hath made us kings and prieſts to God his father,</hi> and the witneſſes come firſt as prieſts in a ſuffering ſtate, and thereia they do part of the work, they do execution againſt <hi>Babylon</hi> by pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring out ſeveral of the Vyals, but from the time of their ſlaughter, and their aſcention, then Chriſt comes forth in his witneſſes as acting immediately towards his kingdom, and then he anoints them with the ſpirit of the kingdom, that ſo they appear not now any longer as <hi>Joſhua with filthy garments</hi> but as the Lord ſays there, <hi>take away the filthy garments from him, and ſet a fair mitre upon his head,</hi> and they did ſo.</p>
               <p>Now by all this, it doth appear, that there are two parts of the witneſſes work, there is one part under ſuffering, during the times of the beaſt, and there is another part after the times of the beaſt are expired, this is the firſt ground.</p>
               <p>The ſecond ground is this, from comparing the
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:57576:64"/>word of God, with the works of God, and that which I have to ſay upon that account, is this; that we ſhall be injurious to the works of God, if we do not ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledg the Vyals to be powred out, there have been ſuch works done, as do juſtly challenge this glory unto them, to be the fulfilling of this word of God, in execution of the Vyals. Every degree of reformation hath powred forth a Vyal upon the Anti chriſtian ſtate, and hath done conſiderable execution upon that ſtate; as I might referr you to the times from <hi>Wickliff</hi> down to <hi>Luther, John Huz,</hi> and <hi>Hierom of Prague,</hi> and ſo down from thoſe times, if we ſhall not acknowledge thoſe works to be the execution, and powring out of the Vyals, upon what account ſhall we place them? what word of God was fulfilled in them? for Antichriſt did receive a conſiderable detriment and imparing by them that is clear and manifeſt, whole kingdoms rent from him, by that reformation. And the work hath proceeded yet further to the detecting of him (I mean of Antichriſt) in his moſt ſpecious ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearances, and to the <hi>darkning of his kingdom</hi> in our day; ſo that they did as the Scripture ſays, <hi>gnaw their tongues with pain</hi> theſe two are general grounds.</p>
               <p>Now more particularly, I would ſpeak two or three words unto you, to clear up this, that the Vyals are to be powred out by the witneſſes, and not as ſome do think by ſome extraordinary inſtruments that ſhall be raiſed up in the very end of time, near Chriſts com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and that may appear from hence from the very name that is given unto Chriſt, in whoſe power all his inſtruments do act and work, this is the name that is given unto him, the <hi>faithful witneſs:</hi> in the beginning of this book of the <hi>Revelations</hi> in the ſalutation, ſo
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:57576:64"/>that I ſay, Chriſt, and all his, do their work by wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſing, and therefore, pray do but mark how the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Ghoſt doth purſue the phraſe in giving an account of all the ſucceſſes of Chriſt, he uſes this word of teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony, I know not what the Vyals are to do, but to overcome the beaſt, and the overcoming of the beaſt is by the <hi>word of their teſtimony;</hi> I grant that term in <hi>Revel.</hi> 12. is ſpoken of the Dragon, and of the primi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Churcn under the ſeals, when under the 6th. ſeal, they obtained the day againſt the heathen dragon, whom they overcame <hi>by the blood of the Lamb, and the word of their teſtimony,</hi> but ſo alſo they overcome all Chriſts enemies, they overcome the <hi>beaſt,</hi> and the <hi>falſe prophet</hi> as well as the <hi>dragon</hi> by the ſame means; and therefore in <hi>Rev.</hi> 19. you will find there, that the beaſt, and the falſe prophet (and the kings of the earth that did manage their intereſt and aſſiſt them) they were ſlain and their party, <hi>by the ſword of him that ſate upon the horſe; which ſword proceeded out of his mouth,</hi> and ſo it is ſaid in 2 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 2.8. <hi>v.</hi> ſpeaking of the <hi>wan of ſin, whom</hi> (ſaith the Apoſtle) <hi>he ſhall con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſume with the ſpirit of his mouth,</hi> ſo that you ſee, it is the witneſſes that are to powr forth the Vyals, and that it is the word of their teſtimony that doth the work, it is not kings nor parliaments, but as they ſhall be raiſed and influenced to be helps in the work in that which is proper for them to do.</p>
               <p>But the chief, the influencing cauſe of all is Chriſt and his witneſſes, therefore ſays the Lord, <hi>I have put my words in thy mouth, the words</hi> of his mouth ſhall bring down the old ſtate of this world, and plant the new, and therefore in conformity to this, we find four of the Vyals powred forth by the witneſſes, during
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:57576:65"/>their ſuffering-ſtate, as in <hi>Revel.</hi> 11. <hi>turning the water into blood,</hi> were two of the Vyals, and the plagues o<gap reason="illegible: in gutter" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap> the earth, and the fire two more, ſo it is eaſy to ſhew you, in <hi>Revel.</hi> 14.18. that there alſo is mention made of 4. Vyals in the vintage, now this harveſt, and th<gap reason="illegible: in gutter" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> vintage are (by the judgment of thoſe that have wai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted upon God in theſe things) apprehended to ſignify (though they do diſtinguiſh them indeed) to ſignify that converſion and bringing in of nations in the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of the reformation, where ſome of the Vyals are hinted, and then there followed another Angel ſaying, <hi>Babilon is falne, is falne,</hi> which they do apply unto the miniſtry of <hi>Luther,</hi> who preached, that all were in a ſtate of damnation, that did abide in the doctrine of the beaſt, and did not come out of it, that was the harveſt, and then the vintage follows, the <hi>gathering of the vine of the earth, and caſting it into the winepreſs of the wrath of God,</hi> which is that fourth Vyal Angel doth cry for, ſo that (I ſay) by theſe things, it is made probable, that the Vyals are powred out moſt of them before this time.</p>
               <p>There is an objection or two, which muſt be an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered before we can carry this away in peace. And that is,</p>

                  <hi>Obj.</hi> That it is ſaid, that the Vyal-angels come out of the temple, and this temple was not opened untill the 7th. trumpet ſounds, as you may ſinde in <hi>Rev.</hi> 11.15. where you reade at the 15 <hi>vers.</hi> the <hi>ſeventh Angel ſounded,</hi> now in the 15. <hi>chap.</hi> it is ſaid, that the 7th Angel came out of the temple, now this is that which many do ground upon, that therefore the Vyals are none of them poured out, becauſe we reade not of the <hi>temple being opened</hi> until the 7th. trumpet.</p>
               <pb n="121" facs="tcp:57576:65"/>
               <p> 
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> Though Mr. <hi>Brightman</hi> delivered his judgment that it ſounded an 100. years ago, yet it is not ſo apprehended by others after him; now that which I ſhall ſay to you, is this, that the temple here ſpoken of, is not that temple out of which the Angels came (the Vyal Angels) that is one thing, and then the other is this, that that temple which is here feon to be opened, was not opened at the coming out of the Vyals, but was opened afterwards, firſt that it is not the ſame temple, miſtake me not, I mean not, that there are ſeveral temples, for there is but one temple; But in the temple you know, there was the <hi>holy place,</hi> or the tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of the prieſts, and the <hi>moſt holy place</hi> into which the high prieſt alone entred; now the temple of the prieſts, that was open all along, that I prove thus from <hi>Revel.</hi> 11.1. where you finde, that the Angel com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands <hi>John</hi> to go and <hi>meaſure the temple of God, and them that worſhip therein,</hi> this was the temple of prieſts, for there was the Altar in the <hi>holy place,</hi> now the other temple which was the <hi>moſt holy,</hi> there was the <hi>Ark,</hi> and that is the temple, which is opened after the 7th trumpet ſounded. <hi>The holy of holies, the temple of God was opened, and there was ſeen in his temple, the ark of his teſtament</hi> Revel. 11. laſt.</p>
               <p>The ark was not ſeen in the temple of the Prieſts, where the Altar was, but it was ſeen in the <hi>moſt holy place,</hi> for thither was the ark carryed, and ſo in that <hi>chap.</hi> 15. <hi>Behold the temple of the tabernacle of teſtimony in heaven was opened.</hi> This is not that ſtate of the Church whiles they were under ſuffering from Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chriſt; but it is that ſtate that the Church enters into after the expiration of the term of Antichriſt, when they are juſt going up into the kingdom, that is the
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:57576:66"/>temple that is opened at the 7th trumpet, and there it is called the <hi>temple of the tabernacle of teſtimony.</hi> Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the ark was called the <hi>ark of the teſtimony</hi> and the tables that were in the ark are called <hi>the tables of teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony;</hi> ſo that (I ſay) theſe temples were diſtinct, that is the firſt thing. The Second thing, that I have to prove is, that this <hi>moſt holy place</hi> is not opened for the Vyals to come out, but is opened after they are come out, for when the Angels are ſaid to come out of the temple, there is no ſpecification, that that temple was the <hi>tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of the tabernacle of the teſtimony, but I heard a great voice out of the temple,</hi> chap. 6. v. 1. now to prove this he ſays in the beginning of the 15th, <hi>chap. I ſaw a great ſigne in heaven, and there is a ſummary</hi> account of the Vyals pouring out, and the victory of the true Church of Chriſt over the Antichriſtian Sinagogue in the four firſt verſes, before you hear of the opening of the ten ple of the tabernacle of teſtimony, for this is a chara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cter that is obſerved throughout the Revelations, where you meet with that word <hi>after theſe things</hi>) as you do in 5th <hi>vers.</hi> there is always another viſion of diſtinct new matter, and that which follows in time af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the former; as for inſtance, after the Lord had diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patch't his minde unto <hi>Johu</hi> in thoſe Epiſtles, in the 2d and 3d <hi>chap.</hi> It is ſaid, <hi>chap.</hi> 4. <hi>After this I looked and behold a door was opened in heaven:</hi> ſo likewiſe in the 7th <hi>chap.</hi> after the 6th ſeal had brought the heathen dragon down, and caſt him to the earth, it is ſaid, <hi>af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter theſe things I ſaw</hi> 4 <hi>Angels ſtanding,</hi> &amp;c. Now this is an evident token of things that do ſucceed and fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low, and are not contemporary, ſo here, <hi>chap.</hi> 15. <hi>v.</hi> 6. It is ſaid, <hi>after the Vyals,</hi> and not before the Vy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>als, of which he had given a ſummary account in the
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:57576:66"/>former verſes, and indeed, if we do but conſider the nature and import of Vyals, that will help us in the diſcerning of this point that is before us, which will ſerve for an anſwer to another objection, and that is this;</p>
               <p>You will ſay the Vyals are the judgments of God upon the beaſt, now this is the order of divine juſtice, <hi>that ſin when it is finiſhed, brings forth death;</hi> but the beaſt had not finiſhed his ſin, at the begining of the times of <hi>reformation,</hi> and therefore it is not to be expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted that he ſhould have his reward, till he hath done his work.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> Yet he had done work enough to be rewar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded for, before the Vyals began, he was not idle, he fell to work immediatly, when once he had power given to him, <hi>he opened his mouth in blaſphemies.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>He had raviſhed the Chriſtian world from Chriſt, before theſe Vyals began to be poured forth: did he not deſerve ſomething for all this? was he not ripe for judgments? all the work that he did afterwards, was very much occaſioned by the Vyals, by the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing forth of the light, and the truth againſt him, which did ſorely vex him, ſo that he behaved himſelf like a beaſt indeed, with great rage, more then before.</p>
               <p>But conſider in the 2d place (mark ye) the import of the Vyals, of which word we read but once, as I know in the old Teſtament, <hi>viz.</hi> of a Vyal, and that was <hi>Samuels</hi> taking a Vyal of oyl; but the Vyals we read of in the Revelations, are full of odours, or the prayers of the ſaints: now there are but 3 things that can fill the Vyals, either the ſin of the enemies, or the judgments of God for thoſe ſins, or the prayers of the ſaints, and I think, they may be all in the Vyals.</p>
               <pb n="124" facs="tcp:57576:67"/>
               <p> It is certain, the prayers of the ſaints are there, they cryed from the primitive times, and ſo down all along.</p>
               <p>The ſins of the enemy, they alſo fill up theſe Vyals, you know what God ſays of the Amorite, <hi>The ſins of the Amorites are not yet full,</hi> for ſo God tells <hi>Abraham,</hi> as much as to ſay, the Vyals are not yet full, I ſhall give you one place here, the Lord ſpeaks much in this kinde of phraſe, <hi>Deut.</hi> 3.34. <hi>Is not this laid up with me in ſtore, or ſealed up among my treaſures?</hi> he ſays before, <hi>Their wine is the poyſon of Dragons, is not this laid up in ſtore with me?</hi> you know there are <hi>ſeven ſeals,</hi> and ſix of them were opened before the heathen Roman was deſtroyed.</p>
               <p>So that all the whole time from Chriſt unto his ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond coming, is all under the ſeals, we are under the ſeals to this day, the 7th ſeal is not ſully opened, till Jeſus Chriſt in perſon be exhibited to the joyful view and beholding of thoſe <hi>that look for him.</hi> All this while God is regiſtring and recording all the ſins of the ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, all their bitterneſs, it is ſealed up amongſt his treaſures, that is the 2d. thing that fills the Vyals, the ſins of the enemy; Conſider that antichriſt had been at work about a 1000 years before ever a Vyal did ſtir againſt him, before the beginning of the <hi>Reformation.</hi> And as there was the ſins of a thouſand years treaſured up againſt him, and the prayers of a thouſanp years for vengeance upon him, ſo there was the wrath of God diſtilling into theſe Vyals, for every ſin brought a drop of wrath into theſe Vyals ſtill, therefore you need not ſay, that antichriſt had not done his work, and ſo was not to have his wages, for you fee he had done a great deal of his work, yea his ſin was full, that is ſo much as was to precede the Vyals.</p>
               <pb n="125" facs="tcp:57576:67"/>
               <p> Now becauſe the time is ſo farr paſt, I ſhall ſpend the remainder of it, in a word or two of application, it is a word of exhortation to us, To be waiting for the return of our Lord from the wedding, and I would not have you think this is th ſame word altogether with that I ſpake the laſt day, thongh if it were, yet it were worth the while, I exhorted you then to watch, and that was againſt ſleeping and ſecurity: I told you in all things, you muſt be as <hi>looking for your Lord;</hi> you may do buſineſs, but with a wakeful ear and eye, to be in a readineſs, to knock off from all affairs, to enter with the Bridegroom, and open unto him imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately, but now I ſay we are called to wait for this Bridegroom; for I tell you, he may be nearer to us, then we are a ware off, and though the preſent time is ſuch a time, that puts the ſaints upon a great diſad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage as to this waiting, and that in two reſpects.</p>
               <p>Firſt it is a dead time, a dull time, a ſilent time, it is a time that hath ſuch a complextion as is moſt diſad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantagious to the ſaints; it is like the midſt of ſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer, and the midſt of winter, there is no fermentati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in the blood (as I may ſay) but all is quiet in the body, ſo it is with us, a ſtill time, our faith doth not work, nor we are not exerciſed but are ſtrangely be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>calm'd, like a veſſel at ſea, neither winde nor tide with it, no waves to waft it over, but there it lies ſtill, ſo is it with a ſaint at ſuch a time.</p>
               <p>Secondly, it is poſſible, it is a time of great confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence to the enemies of the Church, who ſay we have them in a nooze, and they cannot eſcape us yet, and therefore I think it moſt neceſſary thus to apply to the ſaints at this time, and to encourage them, and call up their faith, for I tell you, this is the very complexion
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:57576:68"/>of the time, wheerein Chriſt may be expected.</p>
               <p>It is a time wherein the Church feels leaſt working of any providence towards theſe iſſues, but all things are ſtill, and it is a time wherein her enemies are moſt confident, but this is no other, then what the Lord acquaints us with by the Apoſtle, in that 1 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 3.5. <hi>When they ſhall ſaypeace and ſafety,</hi> that is, when the enemy ſhall ſay ſo, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Now whether this be ſuch a time, or no, judge that your ſelves, wherein the Lords enemies do cry peace and ſafety to themſelves; I confeſs to you, I am continually alarumed in my own ſpirit, and I cannot be out of the hearing of this voice in my ear continually, that the <hi>Bridegroom is coming,</hi> and that <hi>the day of deciſion</hi> is nearer then moſt men do expect.</p>
               <p>I could tell you ſomthing touching the place, which I know is a great objection againſt theſe things: the place where the Lord will begin the glorious diſcove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries of himſelf, and the ſetting up of his kingdom; we do expect that it ſhould be in the great continent of the world, and that it ſhould be all over the world at once, but we may be very much miſtaſten in that, the Lord doth begin his judgments in a particular place. <hi>Revel.</hi> 16.16. <hi>Armageddon</hi> is a particular place, what need they be gathered to <hi>Armageddon,</hi> if Chriſt ſhould take his enemies whereſoever they are all the world o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver? then it were not proper to ſay they were gathered to a particular place; ſo <hi>Joel.</hi> 3. There you have the <hi>vally of Jehoſhaphat,</hi> that is the <hi>judgment of Chriſt,</hi> which he will exerciſe before the final judgment of the dead, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the raiſing of his dead enemies, that have dyed from the begining of the world to that time. We muſt firſt look for the judgment of the quick for they ſhall
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:57576:68"/>be judged before the dead, and I tell you, that it may be made out, that the ſeat of this judgment is not to be all the world over, but in this Roman monarchy, or the ſeat of the <hi>4th.</hi> Monarchy. And perhaps we may bring it into a narrower ſcantling then ſo too, where the witneſſes reſurrection doth firſt appear, there is the lamb, that is the <hi>vally</hi> of <hi>Jehoſhapbat,</hi> there will this deciſion be, it is not only the Weſtern Empire as you have it in <hi>Eſay.</hi> 59.</p>
               <p>But it is, the Iſles of the weſt, yea yet cloſer, it is the north weſt Iſles, chiefly as <hi>I</hi> might ſhew you from <hi>Eſay.</hi> 24.15.</p>
               <p>It is by the Jewiſh Rabbies themſelves applyed to the Iſles of great Brittain, this being the only north weſt Iſle of note in the world there is not any people in the earth, that God hath ſo owned and hononred and tryed, and ſet up ſuch a cauſe and intereſt among them, as in theſe nations, where his ſon hath been owned as <hi>king of ſaints,</hi> his claym hath been put in for theſe kingdoms, theſe things might be made clear to you; ſo that I ſay there may be a begining of that work of God in theſe nations, which other nations are not ready for; I might ſhew you this, from the laſt of <hi>Eſay.</hi> where it is ſaid, that <hi>they that ſhall eſcape</hi> (in that day of deciſion) <hi>ſhall go,</hi> and be inſtrumen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal to bring in other nations, and the nations of the Gentiles muſt be brought in before the Jews come in; this ſeems to be the method of Gods work, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore how neer may the Lord be to the begining of this work, when all this is to be done before Chriſts ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearing, which is but a little time the 1335. days being within a little of coming up.</p>
               <pb n="128" facs="tcp:57576:69"/>
               <p> I ſhould now come to ſhew you how we ſhould wait for the appearance of the Lord.</p>
               <p>Firſt, we muſt wait patiently.</p>
               <p>Secondly me muſt wait with a concern, be ſo con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned for this, as to forget all things elſe in compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſon not to be ſatisfied with ought elſe, though God throw in many things of another nature yet let this be the concern, elſe all is nothing.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, wait in poverty of ſpirit.</p>

               <p>SInce the Lord perſwaded me to anſwer the deſires of ſome of his people to come ſometimes and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear amongſt you; I have endeavoured to acquaint you with the grounds of my hopes and perſwations, that <hi>the day of the Lord is neer.</hi> I have (I confeſſe) through the need I have found of it in my ſelf (as well as from the ſurvey that I have taken of the condition of my fellow members in the body miſtical, needing ſome relief, I have I ſay engaged my minde, and have been wayting upon God for light in the point, that I might have ſome ſatisfaction, <hi>what time of the day</hi> (or of <hi>the night</hi>) <hi>it is,</hi> that we are in, and might have ſome diſcerning of the times, and what God doth in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to do with us: and you know, that <hi>I</hi> have im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parted to you, (what ſatisfaction <hi>I</hi> received in my ſelf) that the times of the <hi>man of ſin</hi> (that is the 42 monthes which were alloted to him) are expired, and that they did end with <hi>Daniels</hi> firſt number of 1290. days men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned in <hi>Dan.</hi> 12. And that we are now in the middle of thoſe 45 yeares, that were to run out from that time until the time that he ſpeaks of, when he ſays, <hi>bleſſed is he that wayteth, ſand ſo comes unto the</hi> 1335 <hi>days, or years;</hi> that is the 45 prophetical days, from the expyring of the firſt number; ſo that by my account and reckoning the time of the beaſt expired, about the year 1650 or
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:57576:70"/>1653. (for there is that difference between Gronolo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers from whence to begin the account from <hi>Julians</hi> time, wherein (ſome ſay the one and ſome ſay the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther) If you take it from the earlieſt account, there are 24. of the 45 years paſt, but if from the latter 21 paſt, and 24 to come. <hi>I</hi> confeſſe, <hi>I</hi> have found a great exerciſe in my ſelf to digeſt ſo long a delay as 21 or 24 years, it is a great while, eſpecially for men that are in years (and according to the courſe of nature, may drop before that time) to wait, which hath put me upon, ſearching exceedingly, if <hi>I</hi> could finde any thing that might relieve in this caſe, if we might yet bring the day of Chriſts glorious appearing neerer; There being ſuch a promiſe left us of <hi>ſhortening the days</hi> (the days of the laſt calamity) but (<hi>I</hi> ſay) it is not for us, upon our own deſires (that would fain do it,) to ſhorten the time, we may not preſume to do it) and therefore for my part <hi>I</hi> am fain to give that up, <hi>I</hi> cannot bring the poſt neerer, then the Scripture ſets it; there may be ſome relief, which <hi>I</hi> do not ſee in other places of the Scripture: Therefore <hi>I</hi> have cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſen this text at this time, here in relief, if the Lord ſhall give us, the experience of it, that is, if he ſhall be with us in the exerciſe of patience, patience will tyde it out, patience will ſecure a good iſſue unto us, and therefore the Lord be with us now, and enable us to be exeroiſed upon theſe words profitably.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Let patience have her perfect work that ye may be perfect and entire, wanting nothing; I</hi> ſhall not take the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary way of diſcourſing this point of patience to you, to raiſe a doctrin and handle it by reaſon and uſe, but <hi>I</hi> ſhall propound firſt to open to you what this pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence is, and Secondly to ſhew you how it is required
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:57576:70"/>of us, and thirdly to ſpeak ſomething that may, if the Lord be with it, and in it, call up this grace in us and help us in the ererciſe of it.</p>
               <p>Firſt, what is patience, the word here tranſlated pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience is <hi>hupomene,</hi> and it ſignifies a ſtanding under, and abiding under the yoak, or the tryal, with continuance, and perſeverance, and with hope, and expectation; there are 3 things in patience, there is <hi>to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lerantia</hi> or <hi>bearing,</hi> and there is <hi>perſeverance,</hi> and there is <hi>expectation.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Patience is not proper, where there is not a burden, where there is not a deferring of good or bearing of ſome evil, now there is both in this occaſion, that calls for the ſaints patience; here is evil preſent, and here is good abſent, here is hope deferred, and here is great tryal and exerciſe preſent, <hi>I</hi> need not ſpeak of theſe particularly, you know that in the Revelations (in two chapters, to ſpeak of no more) the holy Ghoſt doth reflect upon the great exerciſe that muſt be expected would be given unto the patience of the ſaints, by the courſe of <hi>the man of ſin,</hi> that he runs, as 1ſt in <hi>Revel.</hi> 13. Where you have the two beaſts deſcribed, it is ſaid, at the end of the deſcription of the former beaſt, <hi>here is the patience, and the faith of the ſaints,</hi> and 2ly in <hi>Reve.</hi> 14.12. where he ſpeaks of the fall of the beaſt, and of his worſhipers, he ſays, <hi>here is the patience of the ſaints,</hi> both theſe texts (and the latter eſpecially) imply both the exerciſe by a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent evil, and the expectation of deliverance, and of an abſent good, to be given in due ſeaſon.</p>
               <p>Secondly, As there is <hi>bearing,</hi> ſo there muſt be <hi>a continuance a perſeverance</hi> in bearing of this tryal, and in <hi>expecting</hi> of this good, there muſt be a continuance
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:57576:71"/>in bearing, as the Apoſtle ſays in <hi>Heb.</hi> 10.36. <hi>Ye have need of patience that after ye have done the will of God, ye might receive the promiſe,</hi> and ſo all the comfort is to them that <hi>endure to the end, they ſhall be ſaved,</hi> there muſt be a perſeverance; <hi>becauſe thon haſt kept the word of my patience</hi> (it is ſaid to the Church of <hi>Philadelphia</hi>) <hi>I alſo will keep thee from the hour of temptation Rev.</hi> 3.10. And unto another Church he ſpeaks of keeping his works unto the end, there muſt be perſeverance in ſuffering and in doing, and in the aforementioned place in the Hebrews, <hi>ye have need of patience, that af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor ye have done the will of God</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p>Though, indeed, this doing of the will of God, is not only the active part of a Saints life and obedience but his very ſuffering is a doing the will of God, a Chriſtian is active even in ſuffering, for yon may re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member this expreſſion by our Saviour is aſſumed un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to himſelf, ſays he, <hi>Lo I come to do thy will, O God;</hi> he alſo ſays <hi>ſacrifices and offerings thou wouldeſt not, but a body haſt thou prepared me,</hi> that will that he came to do was to be a ſacrifice, therefore a Chriſtian is active e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven in ſuffering, and indeed this is the glory of a Chriſtians patience; Chriſtians do not bear evil as a ſtock, or a ſtone, or as pillars that are made for por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters to ſet down their burden, but a Chriſtian is ſaid to be exerciſed by the things that he bears, and it is ſaid, that they <hi>bring forth the peaceable fruits of righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs, to them that are exerciſed thereby,</hi> a Chriſtian is a lively ſtirring thing, he is exerciſed in ſuffering the will of God.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, the third thing is <hi>expectation,</hi> this is alſo in patience, as the Criticks upon the word ſay, it doth import a <hi>tollerantia, &amp; perſever antia cum expectatione,</hi>
                  <pb n="133" facs="tcp:57576:71"/>there is a trouble they are ſenſible of, in the deferring of their hopes, and in the continuance of their tryals, but this trouble is joyned with a comfortable expcta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, they bear it with an expectation of an iſſue, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording indeed as God hath provided for all his, in all their tryals, whether they be publick or perſonal try<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>als, <hi>God is faithful that bath promiſed, and will not ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer you to be tempted above what ye are able, but with the temptation, will make a way to eſcape;</hi> ſo that a Chriſtian is ſubjected in hope, as it is ſaid the creati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on is, God forbid that a Chriſtian ſhould not have his part in that priviledge, that the whole creation ſhares in, they are ſubjected in hope, how much more the Saints, they ſhall have the firſt mercy, <hi>as they are the firſt fruits of his creatures,</hi> ſo they ſhall have the firſt fruits of redemption, the reſt of the creatures ſhall be delivered, but how and when? why? <hi>iuto the glcrious liberty of the ſons of God,</hi> even as Chriſt <hi>is the firſt begot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten from the dead,</hi> ſo the ſaints are the <hi>firſt fruits of the creation.</hi> Chriſt entred into heaven, firſt, <hi>the foreruner entred for us,</hi> and we follow him, we are called up by him, and received into the ſame glory with him, ſo that (I ſay) there is an expectation in this patience, even <hi>as the hireling waits for the end of the day, and the watchman watches for the morning,</hi> ſo do the people of God wait for the promiſed redemption, <hi>we through the ſpirit do wait for the hope of righteouſneſs by faith, for we are ſaved by hope,</hi> as the Apoſtle ſays in <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.</p>
               <p>But <hi>hope that is ſeen is not hope,</hi> ſo as that now from henec, we gather this, that where there is not an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectation, there patience will be found very weak, and impoteut, and indeed, that will be found to be the account of our impatience, want of faith and hope,
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:57576:72"/>ſo is the ſtrength and firmneſs of our patience, <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham ſaw the day of Chriſt,</hi> he waited with a great firm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of patience, becauſe <hi>he ſaw my day and rejoyced, and was glad,</hi> and therefore let me tell you, friends, upon this account (before I paſs from this particular) it is your intereſt, as well as your duty (I ſay it is your intereſt) to ſtudy the promiſes, to ſtudy the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecies, and to ſtudy the times, theſe three things are to be ſtudyed, it is your intereſt as well as your du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty to do it. I know that you will grant the firſt, that it is your intereſtto ſtudy the promiſes, but alas! this is a lame buſineſs the ſtudying of the promiſes, if you do not ſtudy the prophecies, and ſtudy the times, for to have a promiſe that ſome time, or other, there ſhall be a new ſtate of things, and not have the time diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered to you, this is but a languiſhing tomfort, alas! ſay many, it will not be in our days, as that good man comforted himſelf, that the <hi>evil threatned would not be in his days.</hi> So patience is very lame upon this account becauſe they know not whether it will be in their days or nor, that is the cauſe of ſo great ſlightneſs, in this reſpect they leave theſe things to others, ſay they, you have leizure you can ſtudy the times and the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes, and ſo they take it upon the words of other men; but we may ſpeak long enough, ere we can bear a ſolid ground of comfort into your hearts, if you have it only from our words, unleſs as the Sama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritans ſaid to the woman, ye have heard and ſeen it your ſelves, and ſo know that the time doth draw near.</p>
               <p>And if you ſay, how ſhould we (alas how ſhould we) diſcern thoſe difficult, thoſe obſcure periods that are delivered ſo darkly in the <hi>Revelations,</hi> and other places, let me tell you (I deſire to be free with
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:57576:72"/>you) I know not whether it will ſuit with me or no, to ſpeak oft among you; eſpetially this winter time (though if I were among you, I ſhould embrace the call to be often among you, for it is my comfort) but let me tell you, I have in theſe my poor labours a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong you, directed you to <hi>Dan.</hi> 12. that you might take it, and make ſomthing of it, which you may if you wait upon God; the words are plain, <hi>that from that time of taking away the daily ſacrifice, and ſetting up, the abomination of deſolations it ſhould be</hi> 1290 <hi>days.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>If one ſhould tell you, that at ſuch a time, or at the end of ſuch a period, ſuch an eſtate ſhould fall to you, or ſuch a kingdom beyond ſea, would you not ſtudy it, when this time would come up, though it were ſet a little darkly, it is nothing, but that you have not a heart to it; I beſeech you bear with me, it lies upon my ſpirit as a grief, that people complain ſo of the times, are ſo weary of the times, and would be at bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter things in that regard, and yet they will take no pains to look into the times of the promiſes, if any ſhould give you bonds, will you lay them up in your desk, will you never look when theſe bonds will be due.</p>
               <p>I confeſs it is too plain, and I have no ground to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call my word, I ſtand to the reckoning that I have made among you, that from the time of <hi>Julian the Apoſtate</hi> who in oppoſition to Chriſtianity was engag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to repair <hi>Judaiſm</hi> from that time to 1650. or 1653. the 1290. days came up, and that from thence there are but 45 years to come to the bleſſed period, would you have any thing plaincr, and if the Lord hath ſo conſidered us in ſuch a Scripture as this, we ought, in thinkfulneſs to him, to ſet our hearts to the under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:57576:73"/>of it, if all the interpreters be out, yet we may fetch the ſence of it from heaven, ſtrive then with God, that he would give you ſome account of the prophecies, as to the times, having brought this glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious hope ſo near, as I have done, or as God ha<gap reason="illegible: missing" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>h done to me, and I to you, as within a little more then 20 years, now I lay aſide all my books, and all my reckonings, (though the evidence thereof abids with me ſtill, I cannot bring it nearer, nor can I fee how it is further off) I am now ſtudying the times, and there is a ſelf evidencing light in the times, in the diſpenſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of God, and in his dealings with his people, and his manifeſting himſelf in their ſpirits and forming them, it is a ſelf evidencing property, that is in the diſpenſations of God to acquaint us, what they are, and what Gods connſel and purpoſe is in them. And I have ſound great comfort in this reflecting upon the times; our Saviour ſays it is, that that may afford us light, yea heathens can <hi>diſcern the face of the sky,</hi> and yet cannot we diſcern the <hi>ſignes of the times,</hi> there is as much light to be gathered from the times, if we wiſely conſider them, as our Aſtrologers gather from the face of the sky, as our Saviour inſtances of them, in ſome things, as in a <hi>cloud ariſing out of the weſt, and the blowing of the Southwind</hi> &amp;c. and have we not now a notable cloud ariſing in this weſtern part of the world (ſo that I ſay, there is a light in the times, and truly to give you one iuſtance, I do apprehend, that we may clearly ſee in the times, both diſſolution and reſtitution: though more of the former, then of the latter: you know it is ſaid, that there muſt be a diſſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution before there be a reſtitution, <hi>the firſt heaven and earth fled away from the face of him, that fate upon
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:57576:73"/>the throne, and ſeeing all theſe things muſt be diſſolved, what manner of perſons ought we to be.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Then <hi>I</hi> pray, anſwer me this in your own ſpirits, whether this generation or age, that we have lived in from the times of our childhood (at leaſt the moſt of us that are here) whether it hath not been a diſſolving age. Remember the firſt Scripture that I pitch't up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to give evidence of the times from that <hi>Mat.</hi> 24. <hi>There ſhall be ſignes in the ſun and in the moon, and</hi> how <hi>I</hi> opened them, this is that I ſay we have ſeen in this part of the world, a little model of the great diſſoluti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Churches and ſtates, oh how have we ſeen them diſordered, we have ſeen a <hi>firſt heaven,</hi> and a <hi>firſt earth paſſe away,</hi> though you may ſay it is come again, yet there was a diſſolution; no man can deny, but that is not all, the diſſolution continues, and it works ſtill, the intereſt of the kingdom of God, works in the bow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>els of all intereſts and of all affairs, as it is manifeſt at this day; why, we ſee, there is no glory is able to hold it long but it waxes dim, it paſſeth away, it is but like the muſhrom, that runs up in a night, and but for a night, or like <hi>Jonahs</hi> gourd, as we are told, it ſhall be before the day of the Lord.</p>
               <p>What diſſolutions have there been in Churches, how hath one glory of things riſen up after another, and paſſed away every one of them, they have had their day in Churches, in gifts, in adminiſtrations, in diſcove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, <hi>I</hi> tell you, the <hi>heavens and the earth are viſibly paſſing away.</hi> If you ſhould follow it to the affairs of men in the world, why you will finde it there; what breakings of trade, what confuſions are there; <hi>I</hi> tell you the very joy of the earth is gone, and except it be in a ſew that are reſembled, <hi>by the gleaning after har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veſt,</hi>
                  <pb n="138" facs="tcp:57576:74"/>as you have it in <hi>Eſay</hi> 24.13. Except it be in a remnant, that have hope in God, there is no joy in the earth, when thus it ſhall be in the midſt of the land among the people, <hi>there ſhall be as the ſhaking of an Olive tree, and as the gleaning grapes when the vintage is done, they ſhall lift up their voice, they ſhall ſing for the majeſty of the Lord,</hi> &amp;c. and as it is <hi>Eſay.</hi> 30.29. <hi>They ſhall have a ſong as in the night, I</hi> grant there is ſuch a ſong, as in the night, in a dark ſeaſon, when all things are dark round about us, <hi>there is a ſong as in the night,</hi> which theſe gleanings have, <hi>I</hi> mean this poor remnant, which God ſays in <hi>Zephany</hi> 3 12. he will leave <hi>(he will leave an afflicted and poor people)</hi> they ſing indeed in the ſpirit, but alas as to all out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward things, they mourn, as well as others, they ſee all things to be ſinking, and diſſolving, ſo that all our <hi>rejoycing is in hope,</hi> is in ſpirit. <hi>I</hi> ſay moreover, if you will conſider, as indeed we ought to do, there is not any particular providence towards any of the ſaints, but there may be an intimation in it of Gods viſiting the reſt of their brethren, therefore I ſay, ſtudy the times, and ſtudy the diſpenſations of God to your own particulars, and ſee what light you can finde, for this is that which will be exceeding helpful to you, in the work of patience.</p>
               <p>Now having thus opened patience what it is, I come now to the ſecond particular, And that is the requiring of it; how it is required of us, and with this quality, <hi>Let patience have her perfect work,</hi> what is this work of patience and the perfect work of patience, why you know that patience, is a work it ſelf, it is the work of faith, the <hi>tryal of your faith worketh patience,</hi> ſays the Apoſtle <hi>Jam.</hi> 13. and <hi>tribulation worketh patience, Rom.</hi>
                  <pb n="139" facs="tcp:57576:74"/>5.2. now patience hath a work too, a work of its own, and patience, <hi>experience,</hi> and ſo the one worketh or begetteth another all along, and <hi>hope maketh not aſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med:</hi> now mark you here, all that follows from the firſt work, that <hi>tribulation, worketh patience,</hi> all the reſt is the work of patience, the perfect work of patience, it <hi>works experience,</hi> patience is to make us experien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced Chriſtians: this you know reſults naturally from patience, from the long enduring of tryals, going through many of them (many for kinde; and many for number) we have great experience there by, as a traveller that hath gone through many countryes, he hath gotten great experience thereby, having under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gone many hardſhips, and tryed ſeveral tempers of people, he gets experience; now this is a great ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſhment unto a man, and we commonly menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on it as a very great honour to a man, for a man to be greatly experienced, this is part of the riches of a Chriſtian, you will ſtand for a man of experience in point of Phyſick, the practiſe is the thing that enables a man moſt to do good, and to anſwer your end, ſo it is with a Chriſtian, it is part of his riches and of his glory, <hi>experience, David</hi> was ſuch an experienced Chriſtian, (for they are all Chriſtians that did be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve in Chriſt to come, but I ſay, he was ſo experien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced a Saint) that you could not turn him to any thing; but he was able to anſwer you, ſaying, God was with me in ſuch and ſuch circumſtances, I was able to <hi>encourage my ſelf, in the Lord my God.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>So I ſay we have not only all the experience of the Saints that are gone before us, but God will have us have a treaſure of our own experiences, this is a great matter.</p>
               <pb n="140" facs="tcp:57576:75"/>
               <p> But then ſecondly, this perfect work of patience <hi>(let patience have her perfect work)</hi> indeed I had rather ſum it up in the general, and have you particulariſe at your leizure, and as God ſhall bring them into your minds, in your reading of the Scripture, and in your ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual race, I ſay this ſame perfect work of patience is the perfecting of a Saint, and making him an abſolute piece, in whom nothing can be deſired more, this is imported, or implyed here, in thoſe wor<gap reason="illegible: faint" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>s, <hi>let pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence have her perfect work,</hi> nay further it's expreſt that <hi>ye way be perfect and entire, wanting nothing.</hi> So that it ſhould ſeem that patience doth ſuſtain, or ſupply the place, and do the part (as I may ſay) of all manner of tools to the poliſhing and perfecting of a faint; there is the rough plain, where with you plain at the firſt, and after wards the ſmooth plain, when the rough<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs is taken away, all is in this work of patience.</p>
               <p>I tell you, there is a great deal to be done in a Chriſtian, to fit him for that glorious converſe with Chriſt in the new <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> and therefore you reade in <hi>Revel.</hi> 19.7. <hi>the marriage of the lamb is come,</hi> that is good news you will ſay; bnt mark what is joyned with it, <hi>the Bride hath made her ſelf ready,</hi> his wife hath made her ſelf ready, the Apoſtle tells us; that <hi>fleſh and blood cannot enter into the kingdom of God,</hi> alas! we have been looking for the kingdom of God, but when it did draw a little near unto us, we were as fit for it, as a child is to mannage the affairs of men, and therefore the kingdom of God withdrew from us, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>las we were not fit for it, <hi>fleſh and blood cannot enter into the kingdous of God.</hi> What is the meaning of fleſh and blood there? It is not meant that men in the body ſhall not enter into the kingdom of God, for they
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:57576:75"/>moſt certainly ſhall, <hi>we ſhall not all ſleep, but be changed,</hi> it is not a putting off the body, but fleſh and blood in the falne and corrupt ſtate, wherein there is both weakneſs and corruption, and both theſe muſt be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved, or elſe we cannot enter into the kingdom of God, now the Lord give us a ſence of this, how unfit we are in our preſent fram and temper, for that which we are ſo earneſtly calling for, may it not be ſaid unto us, as the prophet ſpeaks, <hi>it is not for you to deſire the day of the Lord, the day of the Lord is darkneſs and not light, what will you do in the day of the Lord?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I tell you my brethreu, the day of the Lord is a trying day, alas! when it comes to demand of us the giving up of ſuch and ſuch intereſts, or luſts, we cry, O let me fly unto this, it is a little one and my ſoul ſhall live O; let not the Lord dſſcompoſe this part of the old building, we are for keeping up of one, or other ſhedd of the old building: I have been more, within theſe two days, thinking upon thoſe words, <hi>(the carnal minde is not ſubject to the law of God, neither indeed can be)</hi> then I ever was in my life, that I know of, and it is that I ſhould be glad to hear others ſenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of, even the enmity that is in the carnal minde, it is enmity aga nſt God, <hi>it is not ſubject, neither can it be:</hi> I tell you, if yon do not know this by your ſelves, you know not your own hearts and do we think, that we ſhall paſs into that new ſtate of things by tranſlation (we might iudeed have done ſo if <hi>Adam</hi> had not ſinned) out of that which is natural into that which is ſpiritual. But now believe it there muſt be knocking work, there muſt be diſſolving work, and you will feel this, it will put you to pain, I would not diſcourage you, for the Lord will be ut the whole
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:57576:76"/>charge of taking down the old ſtate of things, as well as the ſetting up of the new, and he doth, and wil make his people <hi>a willing ſacrifice,</hi> as <hi>Iſaac</hi> was, he can make this cup to paſs from you, or otherwiſe he can ſweeten it to you, though it be a cup that Chriſh natutal fleſh it ſelf deſired might paſs, yet I ſay <hi>the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit is willing,</hi> and if the Lord pleaſe to call up his ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit in us, it will make us <hi>a willing ſacrifice,</hi> but then is a great change to be brought upon us.</p>
               <p>Now hen having ſpoken ſo much of the time, let me come a little to miniſter of this ſtrength and help unto you, we ſhould look up, to God, that we might be miniſters of the ſpirit, when we converſe in the things of God.</p>
               <p>I ſhall propound two or there things unto you to help you in this tydeing it out with patience. The firſt is this, to reconcile you, to all he hardſhips and try<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>als, all the bitter things that God ſees good to exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe his people with all, conſider the harmony that there is in all the ways and works of God, how all of them conſpire, and work together, they claſh not one with the other, but they are all of them by his wiſe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trivance ſet in their places, as he ſays, he hath ſet proſperity over againſt adverſity, he hath ſet evil days over againſt good days, and they all of them deliver us up, as from Conſtable, to Conſtable, one diſpenſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion hands us unto another, and that to a third, and ſo they all bring us in our journey as the waves, and bil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows of the ſea do, that makes the paſſage rough but yet they carry on the veſſel, ſo do all the waves and works of God, and although you may think here comes a providence that will ſet me quite back again, as <hi>Iſrael</hi> was ſet back in the wilderneſſe, they were
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:57576:76"/>within a little of <hi>Canaan</hi> at their coming out of <hi>Egypt,</hi> they were over againſt the land of <hi>Canaan,</hi> where unto they did paſſe at the laſt, and then they were brought back again) yet God calls this a ſtrait way, yet if you had ſeen it delineated, as I have done, and obſerved their wandrings in the wilderneſſe, you never ſaw ſuch a crooked line in all your life, but the rubbs of a bow I make it run ſo much the ſtronger.</p>
               <p>And this I will propound to your further conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, that all the whole ſchem, and all the ſcenes of Gods providences and diſpenſations to his people, when they are ſet before us in an entire view (as in ſome parts of the Scripture they are) they are called a <hi>ſong,</hi> as in that <hi>Deut.</hi> 32.</p>
               <p>Where <hi>Moses</hi> ſpeaks of the ſeveral changes that ſhould befall that people, he calls it, a <hi>ſong</hi> ſo like wife the book of Canticles which doth prophetically hold forth the feveral changes of the ſtate of things from <hi>Solomons</hi> time to Chriſts coming, it is called a <hi>ſong,</hi> ſo if we could but look upon the whole body of divine counſel, and of divine diſpenſations, as a peice of poeſy or a ſong, it would ſweeten it unto us, you know this age is much given to plays (to Comedies eſpecially which begin tragically but end very ſatisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctorily) ſo do the ways of God, but if you ſhould in a ſong leave out ſome, or any of the feet in any of the lines, the ſong will be lame, it will hobble (as I may ſay) ſo I ſay, if any thing of Gods diſpenſations, if any of his purpoſes ſhould fail, and ſhould not have their accompliſhment, alas! ye whole would want ſomething of its beauty, ſo here in my text: <hi>Let pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence have it's perfect work that you may be perfect, and entire, lacking nothing,</hi> men would be contented, might
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:57576:77"/>they come to the end of their journey though they loſt a great deal of the glory that God intends them by the way, though they loſt the advantages that afflictions would work out for them, as that text ſays, a <hi>far more exceeding wait of glory.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Look upon the contrivance of God, the project of God, there is not any one paſſage, in his whole con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trivance that can be ſpared, not any one trouble either to the Church, or to any particular member, but all conduces to the beauty and the entrance of the whole.</p>
               <p>Secondly, conſider this (and it is a main thing, and I pray ſet your hearts to it) withdraw your own con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerns out of the work of God, and wholly look upon it, as the Lords concern. Let God alone be concerned, do you engage him by your faith, as the himſelf is enga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged in his own glorious counſel and purpoſe.</p>
               <p>That which makes things ſo troubleſome, is, that we take Gods part upon our ſelves, and that makes it ſo heavy, we ſet our ſelves like <hi>Atlas</hi> to bear up the heavens, and the pillars of the earth, alas it is not our work to do it, it is wholly Gods work, it is his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject, and his undertaking, and it is that which he would have us wholly to concern him in, it is his work, it is him glory; ſo that he himſelf is concerned, and he would ſuffer, it any of his work ſhould fail, or miſcarry, pray conſider that, <hi>I</hi> deſire to draw out my heart to you, it is the greateſt comfort <hi>I</hi> have, when I finde weakneſſe in my ſelf. I have a great deſire to live to ſee the glorious time of the Church, and when at any time (as the devil is wonderful buſy to caſt in his fiery darts and diſcouragements into the ſoul, when I finde I am either aſſaulted with a ſudden fear, or that I cannot ſee how that little vigour, and ſtrength I have
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:57576:77"/>ſhould hold out, I finde a great deal of comfort in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flections of this nature, that the Lord is more concern'd in and for me, then I am in, and for my ſelf; and whoever can do ſo ſhall finde and feel the benefit of it, hath not the Lord given his ſon for me, and he that gives his own ſon, <hi>how ſhall be not with him freely give us all things;</hi> are we not his peculiar treaſure then? I ſay leave your ſelves to God, and ſay look thou to it, we may with a holy freedom ſay to the Lord, look thou to it, it is not for us, though we are to ſerve the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence of God, and the publique, yet it is Gods concern, he is to look to it, caſt it upon God, but</p>
               <p n="3">3ly, A third conſideration is his, I have told you, once and again, and now alſo that I cannot bring tho time neerer (the time of our hopes) then <hi>I</hi> have done; but yet conſider this, this time that is yet to run out before that very period comes, wherein he is pronounced bleſſed that waits &amp; comes to that time, I ſay thoſe times that are to run out will be filled with wonders, and with glory that ſhall give ſtrength un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to us, from day to day, from year to year, to await the end to the laſt iſſne; for although it is not ſaid, that <hi>Daniel ſhall ſtand in his lot,</hi> until the end of thoſe days (and then it is promiſed he ſhall) ye <hi>I</hi> ſay there may goundedly be an expectation of higher, more tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cendent and wonderfull works of God that ſhall en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertain his people during their watching and waiting; for you know, who is there that needs watchers at any time, but will provide them entertainment du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring their watching, they ſhall have ſtrong-waters, or ſomething by them, and ſo ſhall the Lords people, you will ſay what entertainment ſhall we have? I muſt tell you I look upon the 45 years as well night half ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pyred,
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:57576:78"/>which is the time, in which Chriſt employs inſtruments for the throwing down of the remainder of his enemies, throughout this whole weſtern world, and the Eaſtern too, the great Turk, the whole ſeat of the 4th Monarchy, all the enemies in theſe two Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pires the Eaſtern, and the Weſtern, Chriſt takes this time to bring them down, and wonderfully brought down they muſt be, and come to their end, this abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance of Scriptures tels us, he will <hi>ſhake heaven, and earth, and the deſire of all nations ſhall come;</hi> and ſo he ſays in <hi>Joel,</hi> he will gather the <hi>heathens to the vally</hi> of <hi>Jehoſhaphet,</hi> and ſo <hi>Zach.</hi> 14.3. But in <hi>Revel.</hi> 16. you read, that at the pouring forth of the 6th Vyal the great river of <hi>Euphrates ſhall be dryed up,</hi> he is drying up <hi>Euphrates</hi> at this day, and this will be a glorious work to ſee how Chriſt gets ground of his enemies, and how the houſe of <hi>Saul</hi> grows weaker and weaker, indeed it would be very little comfort to ſee deſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction and deſolation, if the new ſtate did not put off the old ſtate, as the old nail gives way to the new, or as <hi>Jacobs</hi> ſupplanting <hi>Eſan,</hi> though that new ſtate is not to be ſeen vulgarly, or viſibly, yet the ſaints finde it coming on in the ſpirit (and this if you be reaſona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble men will ſatisfy you, God will ſatisſy his people ere he hath done, and it is your miſtake if you are not ſatisfyed with this way he takes, ſo did <hi>Iſrael</hi> dig up fouutains, and <hi>their rock followed them.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The 4th conſideration is this, that if we did under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand things aright, we ſhould rejoyce with all our ſouls, it would turn to us for a teſtimony, that the Lord holds us in ſo long ſuſpenee, being an argument of the greatneſs of the tranſcendency of the things, that are promiſed, otherwiſe God would not exerciſe his
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:57576:78"/>people ſo long in the wayting for them, think you that God will exerciſe his people with waiting for a trifle <hi>Eſa.</hi> 64.4. <hi>From the begining of the world men have not beard, nor perceived by the ear, neither hath any eye ſeen beſides thee O God, what he hath prepared for him that waiteth for him,</hi> if you expect Chriſts glorious kingdom any otherwiſe, you will be miſtaken, there is no common or ordinary thing; in that day expect no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but wonders, things that are to put your faith to it to acknowledge them when they come to paſſe, that you will be ready to ſay, are we in a dream? as when <hi>the Lord brought back the captivity</hi> of <hi>Sion,</hi> this is that which makes our patience ſo lame, we repreſent the kingdom of God, in ſuch a pittiful poor way, and manner, what is the utmoſt glory that men preſent it in, why? that it will be a time of pure ordinances, and the miniſters ſhall recover themſelves, with their peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, alas, alas, is this all? is this the kingdome of Chriſt? <hi>I ſaw no temple there,</hi> God will bring his people to immediate converſe with himſelf, they <hi>ſhall ſee eye to eye,</hi> God intends to bring his people to a ſtate without ſin, paſt this ſtate of infirmity.</p>
               <p>I confeſs men may give ſuch an account of Chriſts kingdom that may not ballance the charge or trouble of working it about.</p>
               <p>Do you think that God would have ſuffered Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſe to fall, but that he had a better ſtate to bring forth? Do you think that the temple had been ſuffered to miſcarry, but that he had a better ſtate to preſent?</p>
               <p>Do you think that the primitive ſtate had been ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered to decline, but that he had a better ſtate yea bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter then the Apoſtles, better then the Prophets? <hi>We ſee</hi> (ſay they) <hi>through a glaſs datkly,</hi> but in that day,
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:57576:79"/>Chriſtians ſhall be known to whom they belong, you know a waterman by his badge, <hi>the name of God ſhall be written in the foreheads of his people.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>If you look for any thing but wonders in that day you will be miſtaken, things being working to that iſſue, I ſay you will ſee wonders.</p>
               <p>One word more, till Chriſt comes in perſon, let us emprove his ſpiritual preſence with us, which by pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe, ſhall never be taken away.</p>
               <p>And I tell you, as I have told you formerly, it is the ſpirit of Chriſt in the Saints, that is the power by which they ſhall be changed, Chriſts perſonal appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance from heaven bears a part, it is the glorious ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample to which we ſhall be conformed, and it hath a miniſtry likewiſe of enouragement and ſtrengthning; it will call up our faith, and the life of the ſpirit into exerciſe in us, but they muſt both meet, the ſhout of our faith with the ſhout of the Angels, when Chriſt comes from heaven, the ſpirit is that power by which it is done, and that being with us, what advantage might we make to this day of God, through the af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fiſtance of the ſpirit! It is poſſible for men to have the name of the new <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> written upon them, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the new <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> comes down from God, out of heaven, elſe what means that promiſe <hi>Rev.</hi> 3.12 <hi>Him that overcometh will I make a pillar in the houſe of my God, and the name of the Citty of my God, even of the new Jeruſalem,</hi> &amp;c. The overcomer is the perſon to whom this promiſe is made, we muſt fight the good fight of ſaith, we muſt be over coming all our ſpiritual enemies, and this is the work of this preſent day, let the Dutch and others grapple with their enemies, we have other enemies to deal with, though we deſire that
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:57576:79"/>God would fight the battels of his people every where, and give them the advantage in every battle, ye I ſay we have other enemies that we are engaged with; I tell you this overcoming is only by the croſs of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, he is the overcomer that hath ſuffered in the fleſh.</p>
               <p>To this overcomer is the promiſe made of writing on him <hi>the name of the citty of God,</hi> what is the mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of that? why! he ſhall walk in the name, in the power, in the ſpirit of that new ſtate.</p>

               <p>THat the <hi>5th</hi> trumpet is not to be ranged ſo high into the ages paſt (as moſt interpreters do) ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plying it to the incurſions of the Saracens, ſoon after the 600 year of Chriſt, and allowing the ſpace of 700 years well night between that, and the <hi>6th</hi> trumpet, which they place upon the beginning of the <hi>13th</hi> cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tury.</p>
               <p>There are many reaſons to diſſwade, as,</p>
               <p>Firſt, from the general doctrine of the trumpets, it is agreed by all, that the man of ſin, or Antichriſt hath as well his growing, as his judgement and fall under the trumpets; it muſt alſo be affented to, that his ſin muſt be full before his fall and judgment comes; ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly, the four firſt trumpets are the time of his fin and corruption, riſing to the height and breaking forth, and though thoſe trumpets are applyed by moſt expoſitors to the judgment of the beaſt, gradual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly deſtroying him, and may with ſome fitneſs of allu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, find ground and matter for ſuch application, for God, though he gave up the Antichriſtian world to that Apoſtacy, did not forbear to witneſs all along a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:57576:81"/>gainſt their growing corruptions, in ſuch manner as may anſwer the language, and expreſſions of the 4 firſt trumpets) yet I humbly conceive they properly ſet forth to us, the gradual growth of corruption, and degeneracy in that ſinagogue of Satan, and the occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and means thereof, which was 4 fold.</p>
               <p n="1">1. The waxing cold of their love, and the breaking forth of contentions about outward things, expreſt by the haile and fire mingled with blood (and caſt on the earth, the generality of profeſſors) under the firſt trumpet.</p>
               <p>The <hi>2d.</hi> degree, ambition and burning deſire of rule and ſupremacy (in the clergy as they will be cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led) expreſt by the burning mountain, caſt into the ſea under the 2d trumpet.</p>
               <p>The <hi>3d</hi> corruption in their adminiſtrations, by a malignant ſtar falling on the Rivers and fountains un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the <hi>3d</hi> trumpet.</p>
               <p n="4">4ly, A corruption of their light expreſt by ſingling the 3d part of the ſun, the moon, the ſtars, under the 4th trumpet, and here, by this time, things are come to that paſs, that the Lord ſees it time to give a ſtop, and to take in hand to judge this abominable ſtate, and therefore, ſin being finiſhed, ſo far as was ordained to be before (for the reſt of their ſin breaks forth, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der their judgment and it is not the leaſt of their ſin) there is an Angel ſent to fly through the midſt of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, to denounce wo, wo, wo, to the inhabitants of the earth (<hi>i.e.</hi> to the worſhipers of the beaſt) by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of the other voices of the trumpets of the 3 Angels that are yet to ſound now theſe three laſt trumpets being of a claſſis, &amp; ranged thus together, diſtinguiſhed from the 4. preceeding, it is a ſtrong preſumption that
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:57576:81"/>they are of a different nature and import; and that as the former trumpets diſcover the growth of Antichriſts ſin, ſo theſe acquaint us, with the ſteps of his judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, under the 4 firſt, he was climbing up higher, and higher in his ſtate, and in his ſin, under the 3 laſt, he is declining ſtill more and more, and ſinking into the wrath of God, under judgment, till at laſt he is caſt into the lake both head and tail, this is my firſt Reaſon.</p>
               <p>My 2d is from the <hi>non-quadrature</hi> of the application of the 5th trumpet to the Saracens, in reſpect of time; the Saracens, I grant were a ſore judgment, and infeſted the Roman world exceedingly by courſes, and by times, from the year 60 till the time of the Turks pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailing (which was for many hundreds of years) and were that hand and judgment whereby God teſtifyed againſt thoſe growing corruptions of <hi>Rome</hi> all along, while they were ſpringing up, but theſe Locuſts, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the 5th trumpet are bounded, and limited within their 5 months, which take a day for a year, make but 150 years, how this time can give an account of the incurſions of the Saracens by the ſpace of 6 or 700 years, I cannot ſee, nor am I ſatisfied with Mr. <hi>Medes</hi> falve for it, having (I think) good reaſon to diſſent from him, and to underſtand theſe Locuſts under the 5th trumpet of the 1ſt times, of the Turks, from the beginning of the 13th century, while by the ſpace of 150 years, they were very noiſome and offenſive, tormenting the men, that had not the ſeal of God in their foreheads, but not killing them, as after that time they did, for about the year 1450. or 53. as Mr. <hi>Mede</hi> hath noted (out of Hiſtory) was <hi>Conſtantino<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple</hi> taken by the Turks, which was a killing, or an
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:57576:82"/>extinguiſhing of the Roman name in the Eaſt, where you have the 5 months exactly from the 1ſt. uniting of the 4 families of the Turks, under the Ottoman family.</p>
               <p>My third ground is from the mother text, as I may call it, from whence this alluſion of the Locuſts is ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken, which is from the prophecy of <hi>Joel,</hi> (as Mr. <hi>Mede</hi> hath obſerved to my hand) which pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecy throughout, is a celebrating of the day of the Lord, or the day of his judgment in a prophetical ſtrayn, as is in ſo many words expreſly owned more then once, or twice in that prophecy, <hi>chap.</hi> 1.15. <hi>chap.</hi> 21.11.31. and <hi>chap.</hi> 3.12. And in this day of the Lord, judgment begins at the houſe of God, and that takes up the one half of the prophecy unto the 18th <hi>verſe</hi> of the 2d chapter, and from thence to the end, is the judgment of the enemy, and God brings this judgment on the enemy by driving him by a judi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial hand upon acting violence towards his people, which was the violence of the enemy his own heart, only God makes way for it, takes off the bridle, and gives them full ſcope, that he may take advantage againſt them for it, and ſo he doth 2 works at once, he purifies his people by theſe ſcullions, and for their fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy doing of it, takes occaſion to deſtroy them when they have done, now therefore the alluſion being ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken from this place, it is an argument that the work in both places, is the ſame, and that from the iſſuing froth of theſe Locuſts here under the 5th trumpet (the firſt two trumpets) that hour of Gods judgment is to be reckoned to begin, whereof he ſpeaks <hi>Revel.</hi> 14.7. which hour takes in theſe 3 laſt trumpets, and they take in all the times from the begining of the beaſts de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clyning
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:57576:82"/>(which was from the begining of the reforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, or the preaching of the everlaſting Goſpel at the entring of the 13th century) to the white throne, this is my third ground.</p>
               <p>My 4th ground is from a knot of Arguments taken from this viſion of the 5th trumpet <hi>Rev.</hi> 9.</p>
               <p>The 1ſt, whereof is from the accommodation which ariſes from thus ſtating this viſion to that ſchem of the 1000 years myſtical raign, from the downfal of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theniſm.</p>
               <p n="2">2 Hereby the Locuſts under the 5th trumpet, and the army of horſemen under the 4 Angels in the next trumpet are the ſame enemy ſplit into 2 times and actions, as by their characters in the prophecy, they ſeem to be, and not 2 ſeveral enemies as former inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pretations have made them: for they agree in their numerouſneſſe.</p>
               <p>Locuſts are innnmerable as the army of horſemen are in the viſion.</p>
               <p n="2">2. They are both like unto horſes prepared unto battel.</p>
               <p n="3">3. They agree in their breaſtplates.</p>
               <p n="4">4. They agree in their Lion-like teeth and heads.</p>
               <p n="5">5. They agree in their ſerpentine tails and ſtings, ſo that whether you underſtand theſe locuſts, and theſe horſmen of the Turks, or whether you underſtand them more largely of all the power of the Antichiſtian enemy and all his inſtruments, to execute his wrath, they are the ſame enemy acting a 1ſt and a 2d part; the firſt only preparatory to the <hi>2d,</hi> tormenting but not killing; ſo it is ſaid under the 5th trumpet, they were like horſes prepared to battle, <hi>v.</hi> 7. but <hi>v.</hi> 15, there
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:57576:83"/>they are loofed for execution, that were prepared be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore; and we have ſeen how appoſitely, this may be applyed to the Turk, who is the glaſſe, or mirror of all Chriſts enemies under theſe 3 laſt trumpets, as the beaſt is the image and repreſentation of all the <hi>Babilo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh</hi> enemies under that firſt 1000 years of the four former trumpets.</p>
               <p>For theſe reaſons I cannot conſent, that this 5th trumpet, or firſt two trumpets ſhould belong to ſo ancient times, as above a thouſand years ago, but that it belongs to the times of Satan looſed from the year 1300 and that both theſe locuſts, and <hi>Euphrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an</hi> army, and <hi>Gog</hi> and <hi>Magog</hi> at laſt are no other then the whole power of the Dragon, beaſt, and falſe pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet combined, that ſtand up for that cauſe, which Satan hath all along managed, by different parties and methods, whether warrs of perſecutions, or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſitions, and ſo takes in both civil, Eccleſiaſtical and military forces, of Turk or Pope riſing up againſt Chriſt, and his intereſt, or beloved city, whereſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver; and the deſigne of God herein is firſt to purge-and chaſten his Church, and ſo withall to ſpend and dry up theſe waters, according to the import of the 6th Vyal, and in the end to devour them with his fire from heaven, which, whatever it import more and more litterally, according to the judgment that befell <hi>Sodom</hi> we have reaſon (from what is ſaid of the 7th Vyal and many places in the old Teſtament) to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude, and take in the fire of their own diviſions, to which God will give them up to break and deſtroy one another, as the <hi>Midianites</hi> did, and <hi>Moab, Ammon,</hi> and <hi>Mount Seir,</hi> to which way of working out the Churches quiet the prophets do frequently
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:57576:83"/>allude, and we may ſee in part already, this way on foot, in the diviſions between <hi>France,</hi> and <hi>Spain,</hi> and in other parts between men of the ſame pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion, who, one would think ſhould count it as they have done formerly, their common intereſt to agree, and joyne together againſt the belo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved citty, and would certainly continue ſo to do, but that by a judiciall ſtroke from God they are blinded, and ſo fall foul upon one another, therefore let the people of God look up, and lift up their heads, for the day of their redemption draweth nigh, and thoſe that underſtand the Lords deſigne in theſe things will do ſo; whence it is that in the prophets, when they ſpeak of this terrible day and theſe diſmal diſpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſations, they by the ſpirit of prophecy ſee come, as the ſhaking of an olive tree, and as the gleaning grapes, when the vintage is done, that lift up their voice, and ſing <hi>for the Majeſty of the Lord,</hi> glorifying the Lord in the fires, they hear ſome that have a ſong in this night, as when an holy ſolemnity is kept and gladneſs of heart, as when one goeth with a pipe, to come into the mountain of the Lord, this to be, when the earth is made empty &amp; waſte, is ſtrange, but who are thoſe but ſuch as <hi>Daniel</hi> calls the <hi>wiſe that ſhall underſtand,</hi> that know the deſign of God in theſe things, and where they ſhall end, that have the mountain of the Lord in their eye, and ſee theſe things working that way, that know the thoughts of the Lord, &amp; underſtand his coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel, which the blind enemy doth not, <hi>Mich.</hi> 4. Theſe ſit with the Lord in heaven and laugh, for they ſee him about to fulfil that word, that he hath ſpoken, <hi>Joel</hi> 2.18. <hi>The Lord will be jealous for his land, and pitty his people, and remove far from them the Northern army,</hi> as
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:57576:84"/>it follows there, in confidence whereof they even dare their enemies, as it is in the 3 <hi>chap. v.</hi> 11. <hi>Aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble your ſelves, and come all ye heathen, and gather your ſelves together round about, for thither will God cauſe his mighty ones to come down;</hi> and ſo <hi>v.</hi> 12. with a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand more places to this purpoſe, which the occaſions of Gods people have called them to minde, and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaint themſelves with of late times, for which cauſe I need not quote them.</p>

                  <hi>GOg</hi> and <hi>Magog</hi> is that laſt dark black cloud which God in his wiſdom ſees good to bring over his Churches affairs and hopes, when after a troubleſom and dangerous ſea, they are ready to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the port, or haven of their long wish'd expectati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and is that in the body natural, <hi>the laſt enemy</hi> af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter which follows an uninterrupted ſevenity never to end, but in the joy of eternity.</p>
               <p>The falſe images that men have formed to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves of the great works of God to come, have con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly led them out of the way, ſo that they have not known thoſe works when they have been before them, miſtaking both the <hi>Quid,</hi> and the <hi>Quando,</hi> both what, and when they were, which were the 2 grand enqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries of the prophets, as might be inſtanced in all the great works of God recorded in Scripture; would <hi>Iſrael</hi> in <hi>Egypt</hi> elſe have been ſo deaf to <hi>Moſes</hi> meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage, when he came to deliver them? would the Jews have been ſo ſurpriſed with their return out of <hi>Baby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lon,</hi> that they were like them that dreamed? would they alſo have overlook't the coming of <hi>Elias</hi> and Chriſt himſelf had not their minds been prepoſſeſt with other figures and repreſentations of theſe things? like as <hi>Naaman</hi> the Sirian, that thought the prophet would have come forth unto him, and have <hi>ſtroaked the Leper, and have called upon his God,</hi> when his way, was none of all theſe.</p>
               <p>The miſteries of Chriſts kingdome are ſpirituall

               <p>Taking my meaſure hence from the ſpiritual analo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy, I define and determine the general nature and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port of this laſt enemy, <hi>Gog,</hi> and <hi>Magog,</hi> that as the new birth of a ſoul is not without it's pangs and dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers, his courſe, and progreſs through a wilderneſs of temptations, his iſſue and conqueſt ordinarily with a ſharp conflict either at, or before death, ſo the Church, in like manner, at her firſt coming forth is watch't by the dragon, exerciſed all along in the wilderneſſe by the beaſt and falſe prophet, and at laſt when none of theſe wiles can prevail, but that ſhe gets ground every day, and is ready to be crown'd with an abſolute victory and reſt, then the devil being looſed, rages and foams, as he did in the Goſpel, when Chriſt came to eject him out of his long uſurped poſſeſſion.</p>
               <p>To diſcourſe theſe things at large is what I have neither time nor patience now to do, only as to the laſt 2 or 3 brief hints in evidence, that ſuch a diſpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation is common and we are taught to expect it.</p>
               <p n="1">1ſt, From the great law and pattern, our Lord Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt, who as he was ſought to be deſtroyed as ſoon as born, and was all his life time a man of ſorrows and temptations, ſo laſt of all had the ſharpeſt tryal by an hour and power of darkneſs, and the Apoſtle acquaints us, <hi>that whomſoever God foreknew, be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſtinated to be conformed to the image of his ſon,</hi> and therefore,</p>

               <p>In the 3d place hath been the experience of the Saints all along, as if they were all ask't one by one, ho they get to heaven, or to aſſurance in this life, they would all tell you with one mouth, that beſides their ordinary and familiar exerciſes, with which they li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved and were brought up, they had at laſt the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt ſhock and moſt ſignal tryal which was as the part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing blow.</p>

Thus <hi>ſaith the Lord thou art he of whom I have ſpoken in old time, by my ſervants, the prophets of Iſrael;</hi> this is plain alſo in the book of the <hi>Revelations,</hi> the devil that was looſed is the ſame, that was bound, <hi>viz.</hi> the Dragon with 7 heads, and ten horns, he changed his form, and carryed on his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign, by other methods, during his bynding; but the ſame enemy, all along, and when at laſt he reſumes his 1ſt ſhape of a dragon, he carries on his work by the ſame hands of the beaſts worſhipers, all that are leſt him; for the beaſt and his worſhipers were theſe, he entred into at his bynding, theſe he is in a confederacy with, from his looſing, as we have expreſt at the 6th Vyal, by attending this character, we ſhall finde, it is the Roman Antichriſt, from firſt to laſt, for as the beaſt that makes warr upon the witneſſes, is ſaid to <hi>aſcend out of the bottemleſſe pit, Rev.</hi> 11. ſo alſo the
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:57576:86"/>Dragon after the thouſand years of his conſynement, is ſaid to aſcend upon the ſurface, or <hi>bredth of the earth,</hi> Rev. 20.9. For ſo the word tranſlated, they went up, is in the greek they <hi>aſcended,</hi> correſpondent whereunto is their judgment, fire deſcended from God and fell on them, ſo that by this character, the beaſt that ſlays the witneſſes, and the Devil looſed, are the ſame enemy, though this of <hi>Gog</hi> and <hi>Magog</hi> be not the ſame action, for this is after the ſlaying of the wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes.</p>
               <p>Alſo by this character, the looſing of Satan ſhould bear date from the 5th trumpet, the firſt of the wo trumpets; during the firſt 4 trumpets, there was no ſuch wo pronounced, the Church had her thouſand years of a miſtical reign, but under the 5th trumpet, we firſt read of the bottomles pit opened; and although this be by inter preters applyed to the iſſuing forth of the Saracens about the year of Chriſt 600: yet I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive it will be found otherwiſe, and that this open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the bottomleſſe pit was not till about the year 1300, when the devil was let looſe after the 1000 years (from <hi>Conſtantine</hi>) of his binding; of which more here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after: if this hypotheſis can be made out (as I truſt it ſhall) it will diſſolve many knots in the <hi>Revelations.</hi> In order whereunto <hi>I</hi> premiſe, and lay as a fonnda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, that the man of ſin is <hi>the laſt enemy,</hi> the Church is to be exerciſed with until Chriſts coming; and that is clearly intimated by the Apoſtles, 2 <hi>Thes.</hi> 2. where ſpeaking to this argument, the times of the day of Chriſt, he ſhews, it is not to be, till Antichriſt hath run his courſe.</p>
               <p>That may be, you will ſay, yet it follows not, but another enemy may ſucceed, but the Apoſtle cuts off
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:57576:66"/>all pretence to that by ſaying, that this man of ſin is to be deſtroyed by the brighneſſe of Chriſts coming, as much as to ſay, he is to laſt unto Chriſts coming, though he will be much waſted before by the ſpirit of Chriſts mouth, in the miniſtry of his ſervants, and witneſſes, yet ſo much of him will remain, as to give Chriſt the oppurtunity of the laſt, and diſpatching blow at him: whence I conclude, either this man of ſin takes in <hi>Gog,</hi> and <hi>Magog,</hi> or elſe Chriſt ſhould concern himſelf with a leſſer enemy, and leave the greater untoucht, which were not for his honour. I know, what will be ſaid, that <hi>Gog</hi> and <hi>Magog</hi> come not up, till after the 1000 years are finiſh'd, and thoſe 1000 years, begin not till Chriſts coming, and his deſtroying the man of ſin, but how that will be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, that after Chriſt is revealed from heaven, and the new <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> planted in the earth, ſuch an ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my ſhall ariſe, I cannot ſee, for beſides the improba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility, it is flat contrary to the text, which ſaith, the <hi>firſt heaven and earth were put away</hi> before the deſcend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> and <hi>Gog</hi> and <hi>Magog</hi> are deſtroy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by fire from heaven, before the old heaven and earth paſs away <hi>Rev.</hi> 20.10, 11. therefore <hi>Gog,</hi> and <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gog</hi> are not in being after the new <hi>Jeruſalem;</hi> this is my 1ſt ground.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Obj.</hi> But it is ſaid, that the beaſt and the falſe pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet were caſt into the lake, before <hi>Gog</hi> and <hi>Magog</hi> come up upon the ſtage, therefore <hi>Gog</hi> and <hi>Magog</hi> cannot be the ſame enemy with the beaſt, and falſe prophet.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſ.</hi> They are not formally the ſame, but materi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally they are, as the old and new commandment, are the ſame materially, though they differ fromally, or as
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:57576:87"/>the Dragon. <hi>Rev.</hi> 12.3. and the beaſt, <hi>Rev.</hi> 3.2. to whom the Dragon gave up were materially the ſame; for the Dragon was a Roman, and ſo was the beaſt, therefore it was but the ſhifting of a form; in like man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner inter preters hold the firſt, and the 2d beaſt to be the ſame materially; only formally diſtinguiſhing, this therefore I take to be the reſolution of this doubt, that during the 42 months, all things are managed in the name of the beaſt, though as I have hinted from the year 1300. the devil was looſed in him, and acted as a Dragon, but he puts not on the name of <hi>Gog</hi> and <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gog,</hi> till thoſe 42 mouths are expired, which was in and about the year 1650. and from thence begins <hi>Dani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>els</hi> laſt 45 years, which are the times of <hi>Gog,</hi> and <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gog</hi> properly, which <hi>Gog,</hi> and <hi>Magog</hi> are the rem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant of the ſame Roman Antichriſt that was before, but acting now in another rage and ſpirit, and in the very name of the Dragon.</p>
               <p>And to confirm this, let it be conſidered, that the caſting of the beaſt and the falſe prophet into the lake, was rather a damming of their places, their politique and publick capacity and intereſt, then a deſtroying of their perſons and power phyſical, or a judging of them under that form of Antichriſtian abomination: leaving them enemies ſtill in being, as men; that which makes for this, is that they are ſaid to be <hi>caſt alive into the lake,</hi> and the remnant of their party to be ſlain, not with the material ſword, but with the ſword of him that fate on the white horſe, which <hi>ſword proceedeth out of his mouth:</hi> to be ſhort then, the heathen Dragon, the Antichriſtian beaſt, and falſe prophet, and the devil looſed with his <hi>Gog</hi> and <hi>Magog,</hi> are the ſame 4th beaſt deſcribed by <hi>Daniel,</hi> the ſame Roman Monarchy put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:57576:87"/>on ſeveral forms for ſeveral ſcenes &amp; works to be done by them, for the tryall of the Saints, and though the glory of the Roman Antichriſt be ecclipſed, and his name not uſed in this laſt ſcene of <hi>Gog</hi> and <hi>Magog</hi> (which makes him fry in the lake as in his own greaſe for this ſhameful foil) yet he ſhall be alive, till Chriſt's coming from heaven, who will then make void his place litterally, as it was ſpiritually, by the light of truth and conviction in the hearts of men, made void before, during which interim, from his dejection into this lake (of vexation and diſappointment) untill Chriſts glorious appearing, the Dragon who joyned forces with him againſt him that ſate on the white horſe, before his fatal diſcomfiture, ſhall take up the bucklers, and by himſelf manage the warr againſt Chriſt, till he deſcends from heaven with his mighty Angels, in flaming fire, and conſumes him, and his forces, diſables him as he did the beaſt before him, and caſt him (even the Dragon) alſo into the ſame lake of torment, wrath, vexation, enmity, and diſappoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: of theſe notions I ſay as of the former Hypothe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſis, if they can be made good, they will do the buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe.</p>
               <p>My ſecond ground is this, Antichriſt, the beaſt, the man of ſin, the falſe Church, the whore of <hi>Babylon</hi> receive only a miſtical judgment and deſtruction be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Chriſts appearing from heaven, then, and not till then, will be the manifeſt abolition, and deſtruction of theſe enemies, they will live, and breathe though under judgment, till that moment that Chriſt may have the glory of deſtorying them, and that they may fell the terror of his hand in their deſtruction, elſe what means that of the Apoſtle, that Chriſt ſhall <hi>deſtroy
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:57576:88"/>the man of ſin with the brightneſs of his coming,</hi> there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore 'tis, that at the laſt Vyal of all, we reade of great <hi>Babilons</hi> coming up in remembrance before God, which ſhews that (whatever interpreters invent of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother <hi>Babilon</hi> at <hi>Conſtantinople</hi> to ſalve it) the 5th Vyal poured on the throne of the beaſt, did not diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patch <hi>Babilon,</hi> and that the 18th <hi>chap.</hi> of the <hi>Rev.</hi> hath only a miſtical fulfilling till Chriſt comes from heaven.</p>
               <p>It will be objected that the papacy muſt be deſtroy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed before the Jews be converted, their Idolatries be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a great let to the Jews receiving the Goſpel. I anſwer, that this is a conjecture no where that I know determined in Scripture, I grant that the Idolatries of <hi>Rome,</hi> and the ſuperſtitions of thoſe that come too near the Papiſts may well be look't upon as a great hinde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance to the Jews embracing the Goſpel, but that God cannot carry them over this block I fear to af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm.</p>
               <p>Nay 2ly, I do expect the Jews return into their own land, before they embrace the Chriſtian faith, and that their firſt ſtirring and reſtoring will be as truly, while they are in their blood, as their firſt planting was: but after that, when they are ſetled, the Lord promiſes to pour clean water upon them, and for ought appears to me, God may make uſe of the Eaſtern <hi>Gog and Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gog</hi> (whom he will bring againſt them) for an awak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of them, to himſelf, and will be ſanctifyed in their eyes by his appearing for them, againſt that ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, which deliverance he will likewiſe ſanctify unto them, for the turning their hearts back again unto him, and the receiving of him, whom he ſent unto their fathers, and now ſends again, to be their delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers from this laſt enemy.</p>
               <pb n="167" facs="tcp:57576:88"/>
               <p> My third ground is the Analogy between the courſe of the ancient Church and people of God, the Jews, and us gentiles, for they are our types, as the Apoſtle ſaith 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10.</p>
               <p>Now there is not the leaſt colour, or footſteep for the expectation of any the leaſt diſturbance of the new <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> ſtate by <hi>Gog</hi> or <hi>Magog,</hi> or any other ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, yet <hi>Ezekiel,</hi> and other of the prophets prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy of this new <hi>Ieruſalem,</hi> and this is a certain truth, that the whole Syſtem and body of prophecy, was made up in the times of the old teſtament, and therefore it is ſaid, the <hi>prophets prophecyed until Iohn;</hi> the new Teſtament being called the <hi>fulneſs of times,</hi> for this cauſe, becauſe it is the time not of giving forth new prophecies, but of fulfilling the old.</p>
               <p>And therefore the book of <hi>Revelations,</hi> is but a col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lection of the old prophecies, as to the ſubject matter thereof, but (which was that which none of the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets could do) there is made an orderly digeſtion, diſtribution, and applycation of them in the order of times to be fulfilled, and all the ſcenes that concern us Gentiles, are with alluſion to the like, that have been, or are to be fulfilled among the Jews, and are delivered to us in the language of thoſe types, as might be inſtanced throughout the whole book of the <hi>Revela.</hi> from one to the other; now we finde in the prophets no <hi>Gog</hi> and <hi>Magog</hi> prophecyed of, to infeſt the new <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> but before it commences, we have a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecy thereof at large by <hi>Ezekiel,</hi> which is an argument <hi>I</hi> know not how any can get over, therefore either the new <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> is not the ſame ſtate which the 1000 years, or <hi>Gog</hi> and <hi>Magog</hi> muſt precede the 1000. years raign, which is contrary to the text, or elſe the
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:57576:89"/>Gentiles new <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> ſtate muſt be caſt in another mould quite, then the Jews is: I ſay one of theſe 3 muſt follow, if we have a <hi>Gog,</hi> and <hi>Magog,</hi> to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turb us after it, when the Jews ſhall have none but only before theirs, and ſo God muſt vary his rule and way, and his oeconomy and diſpenſation to one part of his own family, muſt be on this wiſe, and to another on that wiſe, in this particular, which is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like in all others, which without better grounds to ſuppoſe it, <hi>I</hi> cannot admit.</p>
               <p>My 4th ground is, that by this Hypotheſis there is a fairer account given of the 2 beaſts, <hi>Rev.</hi> 13. and of their diſtinction, then the ordinary expoſition doth afford; if we take the time of the 2d beaſt, for the times of Satan looſed, when the beaſt that was ſo plauſible and taking before, changes his ſhape &amp; form, and puts on a dragon-like rage and cruelty; I know this will ſeem very abſurd, to ſuggeſt, becauſe of the hornes of the lamb, that are ſeen on this 2d beaſt, what more unlike a dragon then a lamb ? but let it be conſidered withall that this 2d beaſt ſpake like a Dragon, ſo that there is ſomething of a Dragon and a great matter too: the mouth of the Dragon is as bad a part as any, for with that he ſ<gap reason="illegible: blotted" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap>s fire, as we commonly ſay, and poiſons with his breath.</p>
               <p>But 2ly, Let us conſider this 2d beaſt is not only 2d in way of numeration, but in the order of his ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing, ſpringing up after the other, which though not ſo plainly expreſt by <hi>John</hi> in the <hi>Revel.</hi> but only couch't in thoſe general intimations of the other beaſt, and the firſt beaſt before him, yet is expreſly noted by <hi>Daniel; Dan.</hi> 7.24. Another ſhall riſe after them, <hi>i.e.</hi> after the 10. horns, and he ſhall be divers from the
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:57576:89"/>firſt, and he ſhall ſubdue 3 kings, and into the hands of this horn it is that times and laws ſhall be given, <hi>un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>till a time and times, and the dividing of time, which time, times and dividing of time, cannot be the</hi> whole 42 months of the beaſt, or the 1260. days of the wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes fackcloth-prophecy, as they are commonly ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded, for that this beaſt riſes after the 10 horns not with them, nor preſently after them, it is to be ſuppoſed, for that would be as good as with them, but many hundreds of years after them, and let it be obſerved that this phraſe and reckoning, is but once mentioned in the <hi>Revelation,</hi> and that is <hi>chap.</hi> 12. and then 'tis applyed, not to the beaſt, but to the ſerpent (or dragon which is all one) and that not to his times before his caſting down out of heaven, nor to his times, while he was ſhut up in the pit, but as I ſuppoſe to his laſt times of looſing again, <hi>Rev.</hi> 12.14. for I take this 12th <hi>chap.</hi> for a compendium or abſtract of the Dragons ſtory, from his dethroning by <hi>Conſtantine</hi> to his laſt treading of <hi>Gog,</hi> and <hi>Magog,</hi> where we finde a 2 fold fight of the woman.</p>
               <p>The firſt <hi>v.</hi> 6. making an opportunity for Antichriſts raſing, or rather giving way to him, at his coming forth.</p>
               <p>The ſecond <hi>v.</hi> 14. Upon the devils looſing, for this double ſlight is paralel'd and anſwer'd with a double ſcene of trouble from the Dragon, the one preſently upon the birth of the manchild, who had got into the throne in heaven, being caught up thither, the Dra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gon and his Angels ſought to have deſtroyed this inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt, but prevailed not.</p>
               <p>The 2d is after a 1000 years, when this manchild had ſo long carried heaven away from the Dragon,
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:57576:90"/>and that the beaſt and his followers, to whom the Dragon reſigned, were diſcovered now by the dawn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of reformation (which then began about the year 1300) to be but an earthly crew, the Dragon bethinks himſelf, what uſe to employ them to, and finds they were apt and ſit to make inſtruments of outward trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and perſecution againſt the heavenly ones, and ſo he employs them that way, for the firſt warr was in heaven, but this latter on the earth, the firſt warr was managed by the Dragon and his Angels, learned men, and religious men; for it is ſaid, that the Dragons tail drew the 3d part of the ſtarts from heaven, and did caſt them to the earth <hi>(i.e.)</hi> he made them of his party for an earthly intereſt, which yet they coloured with the name of heaven, and with pretended mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles and jugling tricks ſought to cozen the world, and to put the cheat of a falſe and adulterated Chriſtianity upon them, wherein he prevailed upon the inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants of the earth, <hi>all whoſe names were not written in the lambs book of life,</hi> but the woman and her heaven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly off-ſpring, hold out againſt the Dragon, <hi>Michael</hi> and his Angels got the day, and the Dragons place was <hi>fonud no more in heaven:</hi> then comes on the <hi>2d</hi> war after the 1000 years wherein the dragon betakes himſelf to outward force, then the woman flees the 2d time into the wilderneſs, from this 2d ſtate of the beaſt and his warr, and under this aſſault ſhe is helped by the earth, which availed nothing to her help in the former warr, but here the earth opened her mouth and ſwallowed up the flood, as we ſhall ſhew hereafter: how king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms engaged, and ſtood up for the witneſſes, bear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing off much of the ſhock of warr, and perſecution from them, untill at laſt the Dragon ſiugles out the
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:57576:90"/>remnant of the womans ſeed, and goes forth with great rage, to make warr with them, and to ſwal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low them up (<hi>v.</hi> laſt of the 12th) which I take to be his laſt attempt, and properly to referr to <hi>Gog</hi> and <hi>Magog,</hi> wherein as in all his former, he ſhall fail, and ſhall make leaſt of all of it, as ſhall be ſhewed in it's place; This is my Scheme of this chapter, and to confirm this, obſerve, that in this laſt warr, to give light to us, that it is the looſing of Sathan, which is to be, but for a ſhort time, as it is ſaid <hi>Rev.</hi> 20.3. it is ſo noted in this, <hi>Chap.</hi> 12.12. upon the devils com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing down, failing of his enterpriſe (by the beaſt his Angels and jugling tricks) to recover heaven, that he had <hi>great wrath, becauſe he knew, that he had but a ſhort time,</hi> and then 2ly, in the laſt ſcene of this laſt warr, for there are ſeveral ſcenes in it, as we ſhall ſhew (the battel of the white horſe being the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer part of this war) he is ſaid only to go forth to <hi>make warr with the remnant of the womans ſeed,</hi> which ſhews this action to be removed far in time from the primi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive ages, and the perſecution thereof, for the Church then was the woman, but theſe are the progeny, the offspring, the ſucceſſors of the Church, many ages afier, not the woman clothed with the ſun, not in the glory of the primitive purity and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection, but a poor weather-beaten remnant, that had rid out the ſtorm, and kept the word of Chriſts pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, and have the <hi>teſtimony of Ieſus,</hi> but little applauſe in the world.</p>
               <p>There lyes one objection againſt this in the 12th <hi>chap.</hi> and that is <hi>v.</hi> 14. where the 2 wings of a great Eagle, that were given the woman, are interpreted of the Roman Empire into Eaſt, and Weſt, which
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:57576:91"/>challengeth this flight to thoſe earlier times even the firſt riſing of the beaſt.</p>
               <p>To which I anſwer, that it is but a preſumption ſo to interpret the wings of the Eagle from the congruity of the alluſion to the Roman Enſignes, but we may as well, and I think more groundedly derive this me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taphor and alluſion from <hi>Moſes</hi> ſong (when the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man Eagle was not in being) <hi>Deut.</hi> 32.12. <hi>As an Eagle ſtirreth up her neſt, fluttereth over her young, ſpreadeth abroad her wings, taketh them, beareth them on her wings, ſo the Lord alone did lead him; ſo alſo</hi> Exod. 19.4. <hi>ye have ſeen what I did unto the Egyptians, and how I bear you on Eagles wings, and brought you to my ſelf.</hi> Lo, here the Lord is the Eagle, his mercy and truth, his high and eminent ways of ſalvation are the 2 wings of the great Eagle diſplayed for his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, and it is more probable and congruous to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand the Lords ſpeaking according to his ancient types in Scripture, then according to modern conjectures of men while, I am pondering. There is another objection to be removed, and that is, that that which <hi>I</hi> call the firſt warr, or the wart in heaven, cannot be that which the Dragon managed by the beaſt, for that the beaſt is ſaid in his war with the ſaints to <hi>over come them, Rev,</hi> 13.7. But in this warr in heaven. <hi>Rev.</hi> 12. The Dragon prevailed not, neither was his place found any more in heaven.</p>
               <p>I anſwer, both theſe may ſtand, the beaſt did over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come <hi>(i. e.)</hi> he maintain'd his beaſt-like rule and kingdom in the ſubjects that were given him to rule over, which were the dwellers on earth, whoſe names <hi>were not written in the book of life, of the lamb ſlain from the foundation of the world,</hi> but the Dragon who
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:57576:91"/>managed this warr by the beaſt, with a deſire, and deſigne to hinder Chriſtianity from taking root, and to relieve the loſt heaven to his own party, he prevail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed not in his deſign, for the woman in the wilderneſſe carryed heaven in her banners, and Antichriſt, and all his party were manifeſted to be but an earthly fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nagoge, and eſpecially as the Reformation grew on which occaſion'd the 2d warr: Thus we ſee the firſt warr was waged in heaven, a ſpiritual orbe and ſphear, and managed by the dragon and his Angels, the Pope and his Cardinals, and Angelical Doctors, and this by the ſpace of a 1000 years from the down<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fall of heatheniſm; and if it be ſaid the Pope uſurped alſo a ſecular power, and uſed the material ſword de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing kings, and Emperors, I anſwer it was chiefly for ſetling his own uſurpation, and to faſten his horns on his own head, where in alſo he prevailed more by his impoſtnres, then by his armes, warring not as the Dragon, but as the beaſt: and now having made this way, let us take a view of the Dragon and his army <hi>Gog</hi> and <hi>Magog,</hi> and their action, and the time of it, and the deſigne and counſel of God in it, and the iſſue he will make, and that uſe he would have us to make of it in the interim.</p>
               <p>The time we have already hinted to be from the 5th trumpet with ſome reaſons for it, which <hi>I</hi> ſhall now draw forth in order particularly, as,</p>

The Dragon or Devil, to this laſt enterpriſe of his, is ſaid to be looſed out of his priſon, <hi>Rev.</hi> 20. which priſon is expreſt above, to be the bottomleſſe pit: accordingly at the 5th trumpet a ſtar fell from hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, and <hi>to him was given-the key of the bottomleſs pit, and he opened the bottomleſs, pit, and there aroſe a ſmoke out of the pit, &amp;c.</hi> and out of <hi>the ſmoke came Locuſts,</hi> Rev. 9.1.4. again <hi>chap.</hi> 11. the beaſt that makes warr upon the witneſſes, which is this time of Satan looſed, aſcends out of the bottomleſs pit, this is that little horn in <hi>Daniel,</hi> that roſe after the ten, and was divers from the reſt, and therefore <hi>Rev.</hi> 17. he is call'd the <hi>beaſt that was, and is not, and yet is,</hi> for he ſhall aſcend ſaith the holy Ghoſt, <hi>v.</hi> 8. out of the bottomleſs pit, therefore becauſe of the different ſtate of this warr from the former, he is ſaid to be the eighth head though he be of the 7, <hi>v.</hi> 11. what further evidence I have for taking the 5th trumpet within this time, I ſhall offer in the end of this Diſcourſe by it ſelf, before I leave this circumſtance of the time of this enemies coming forth, I ſhall make this obſervati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an, that as the 4. firſt ſeals were different from the three laſt, for under the 4. firſt ſeals which were more mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derate, the living wights cry, <hi>come and ſee,</hi> but at the 5th ſeal there is another cry of the ſouls under the Altar, for as the full of the heathen-ſtate drew near, the perſecution was more fierce and general; ſo like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe the 4. firſt trumpets were a calm time wherein the Saints had their 1000 years miſtical and ſpiritual reign with Chriſt, comparatively to the 3 laſt trum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pets, when the fall of <hi>Babilon</hi> drew near, then the beaſt beſtirs himſelf, and ſeeing his juglings and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtures

               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> I grant, the 5th trumpet ſounded many ages a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>go, ſome, and that of great note as Mr. <hi>Mode,</hi> and others pitch it in <hi>Anno Chriſti</hi> 600, but under favour, do, I conceive miſs it, for the harmony of this whole hypotheſis, I pitch it in 1300. which, yet, I grant was too early, for this-ſingle action of <hi>Gog,</hi> and <hi>Magog;</hi> we ſay not therefore that <hi>Gog</hi> and <hi>Magog</hi> iſſued forth ſo ſoon, but then the Devil was looſed, and he hath employed his time ſince that in other actions, <hi>viz.</hi> in making a continued ſucceſſive warr againſt the witneſſes, or him that ſate on the white horſe and his army, wherever he hath appeared, fighting him from field to field, from country to country, though he hath come off with loſs in all, the ſerpent bruiſing Chriſts heel, but receiving a broken head in return thereof, under the <hi>6th</hi> Vyal, we reade of this gather<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to <hi>Armageddon</hi> by the inſtigation of the; unclean ſpirits, <hi>out of the mouth of the Dragon, and out of the mouth of the beaſt, and out of the mouth, of the falſe pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet,</hi> where you ſee the Dragon is engaged and joyn'd in commiſſion with the beaſt and the falſe prophet, and here the ſpirits that gather the kings of the earth to battel, are ſaid to go out of the mouth of the Dra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gon, as well as out of the mouth of the beaſt; the Phraſe is ſuited to that in <hi>Rev.</hi> 12.15. where in the lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter warr, the Dragon is ſaid to caſt out of his mouth
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:57576:93"/>water (as if there were one action and time) that is, people or armies) <hi>as a flood after the woman;</hi> by this you ſee that notion confirm'd of the 2d beaſt, to be of this time (as was before noted) by the particulari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty before hinted of, ſpeaking <hi>as a Dragon,</hi> you ſee what the Dragons mouth is, and what is his ſpeaking, it is the ſpouting forth his venimous flood after the woman; now this warr laſts from the beginning of the Reformation about the year 1300 till <hi>Daniels</hi> 1290 days come up, that is till the years, which are the <hi>time, times, and a half,</hi> and then begins <hi>Daniels</hi> laſt 45 years, or the times of <hi>God</hi> and <hi>Magog</hi> properly, which are under the ſole conduct and management of the dragon as <hi>Generaliſſimo;</hi> at laſt the beaſt and falſe prophet lying down, and relying on his arm and help, which time <hi>is ſaid to be ſuch a time of trouble, as hath not been ſince there was a nation, nor ever ſhall be;</hi> yet at this time is the Church of God both Jews and Gentiles to be delivered.</p>
               <p n="2">2. This is the time allotted for the harveſt and vin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage <hi>Rev.</hi> 14.14. to the end of the chapter, wherein God hath been meaſuring the ground and parts of the reformation, with warr and deſolation, for their ſlackneſs, negligence, and growing cold therein, in bringing forth the fruits thereof, as we may ſee in <hi>Germany, Bohemia,</hi> and the Palatinate, and other places beyond the ſeas, and laſt of all, theſe Iſlands giving up the outward court in all theſe parts of <hi>Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rope</hi> to the Gentiles, to be troden down and brought under, as he had given up the Eaſtern Empire before to the Saracens, and then to the Turk, the witneſſes mean while pouring out the Vyals of <hi>Babilons</hi> miſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal deſtruction, which exaſperates the Devil ſo much the more.</p>
               <pb n="177" facs="tcp:57576:93"/>
               <p> But it will be demanded, what ground I have to aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigne ſo long a time as 350 years to the looſing of Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan, when the holy Ghoſt ſaith, he is to have but a ſhort time?</p>
               <p>A 350 years is but a ſhort time comparatively, not only with eternity to follow, in which reſpect the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle ſaith, <hi>our light afflictions which are but for a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi> &amp;c. but alſo in reſpect of the whole duration of the 4th beaſt, the Roman Monarchy, whereof theſe are the laſt times, yea alſo in reſpect of the 42 months or 1260 years of the laſt head of that beaſt, the Papacy.</p>
               <p n="2">2. That they are 350 years, beſides the congruouſneſs of ſo underſtanding the phraſe of <hi>time, times, and a half,</hi> we find <hi>Rev.</hi> 9.15. an army prepared there (which I judg will prove to be of this time) <hi>prepared</hi> (I ſay) <hi>for an hour and a day, &amp; a month, and a year,</hi> which meaſure of time leaving out the hour and the day, for a reaſon I ſhall ſhew anon, and reckoning the month, and the year by days, and taking a day for a year, they make up 395 years, which is 45 years more then the 350, and are as I conceive the whole time from the Devils looſing to the deſtruction of <hi>God</hi> and <hi>Magog,</hi> 350. of which years the Devil is trying his fortune (with the beaſt and falſe prophet helping him) and all that time they are preparing for this laſt ſcene of <hi>God</hi> and <hi>Magog,</hi> the ſcene of <hi>Daniels</hi> extraordinary troublous time, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore which comes, the beaſt and falſe prophet are off their legs, as I noted before, and the dragon is left with the ſole command of the armies.</p>
               <p>Now the reaſon why I leave out the hour, and the day, in that computation is, for that I conceive, they are to be reckoned apart, and are as much as the
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:57576:94"/>month and the year, and may be called Gods day and hour, as the other reckoning is more prophetick; and if a prophets day be a year, Gods day is a year of years that is 365 years; and if a prophets hour be the 12th part of a year (which is a month) then Gods hour is a month of years <hi>(i. e.)</hi> 30 years which being put to the 365, makes 395 years, and ſo the account is doubled to confirm it, as <hi>Joſeph</hi> ſaid of the dream; and that they are to be look't on as 2 diſtinct computations, and not as one is probable, not only for their quadrating with the <hi>time, times, and a half</hi> (with <hi>Daniels</hi> laſt 45. years added to them) with the end of which, they ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>actly come up from the year 1300, when the Turks brake forth, and when I held Satan was looſed: but alſo for that there is no week in this ſcale, as for con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gruity there ſhould have been, if the deſign had been to ſet forth an entire time in a way of aſcending: but it is not ſaid an hour, a day, a week, a month, and a day is one reckoning, and the month and year another, yet both of the ſame quantity of time.</p>
               <p>I have done with the time both beginning, and duration, I come now to the ſubject it ſelf, <hi>Gog,</hi> and <hi>Magog,</hi> the dragons army, and their action.</p>
               <p>There is a 2 fold <hi>Gog</hi> and <hi>Magog,</hi> the firſt we read of in <hi>Ezek.</hi> which concernes the Jews, the latter in the <hi>Revelations,</hi> which concerns us Gentiles, and this latter is but briefly handled, referring us (as I ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe) to the larger deſcription of them in <hi>Ezekiel.</hi> By comparing both, we may draw out of them ſuch par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulars wherein they agree and are paralel, we have already obſerved <hi>Gog</hi> and <hi>Magog</hi> is an old well known enemy, the remainders of the 4th beaſt, the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:57576:94"/>Monarchy, and as Dr. <hi>Holmes</hi> hath ingeniouſly obſerved the deſcription of the latter horn, may ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry appoſitly be applyed to the Turk as well as to the papacy, who have raviſhed 3 horns from the Roman Empire; <hi>viz. Aſia Graecia,</hi> and <hi>Syria,</hi> as the Pope hath impropriated and ſeized 3 to his <hi>Peters</hi> patrimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny to maintain his tripple crown. We have alſo ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved that this is the laſt enemy, and the laſt tryal that either Jews, or Gentiles ſhall have.</p>
               <p>Now to proceed, the firſt character ſpecifycating this enemy and action that I ſhall inſiſt on, is that qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity of the juncture of time in which <hi>Gog</hi> and <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gog</hi> ſhall make this attempt, which is not only ſaid ſhall be in the latter days, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 38.8.16. But it is ſaid, <hi>he ſhall come into the land that is brought back from the ſword, and is gathered out of many people againſt the mountains of</hi> Iſrael, <hi>which have been always waſte, but is brought forth out of the nations, and are dwelling ſafely, having gotten cattle and goods, gold and ſilver, and great <gap reason="illegible: blotted" extent="1+ letters">
                        <desc>•…</desc>
                     </gap>ile,</hi> this is a main circumſtance for the diſcovering of this enemy and action; <hi>Gog</hi> and <hi>Magog</hi> appear not againſt the Jews till they be reſtored to their own land and are ſetled there, and are in great ſecurity, and are recruited and grown rich: In like manner when the people of God among the Gentiles ſurrogated <hi>Iſrael,</hi> that have been troden down by the Gentiles (the pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacy and thoſe of that ſpirit are brought back from the ſword and brought forth of the nations (their cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptions and mixtures) and are arrived at a good de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree of Reformation and proſperity therewith, this is the time to look for <hi>Gog</hi> and <hi>Magog,</hi> and if you ſee ſuch a people after ſuch a Lot as this, even when they are ready to enter the port and haven of their deſires
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:57576:95"/>to have ſuch an enemy let looſe upon them, it is very ſuſpicious to be this enemy, to be this ſcene of <hi>Gog</hi> and <hi>Magog,</hi> I ſay if all other things ſuit, as if the beaſt hath had it's time of 42 months, and the other ſcenes that were to precede are over, this is a greater cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter of <hi>Gog,</hi> and <hi>Magog.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. He comes as a ſtorm ſuddenly, violently, comes upon the intereſt of God in their ſecurity, he comes as a cloud for number and multitude, not to be turned back, <hi>v.</hi> 9. that is another character.</p>
               <p>Both theſe particulars you have alſo <hi>Rev.</hi> 20. It is after the 1000 years of the Churches peace, and reſt from the Dragon, that Satan is let looſe, and after the Churches cauſe pleaded and decided againſt the beaſt and the falſe prophet, and the kings of the earth, that helped him, after great ſuceeſs in battel againſt the Antichriſtian party, after all the fowles were filled with the fleſh of kings, and captains, and mighty men (which I take to be the ſame with that in <hi>Eze<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kiel,</hi> had gotten goods, and cattel and ſilver, and gold, and great ſpoil) then <hi>Gog</hi> and <hi>Magog</hi> rallies the rem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant of a diſſolute party &amp; comes againſt this intereſt, and he comes as a cloud with numbers, and multitude, as the ſand of the ſea.</p>
               <p>That we may make clear work, as we go, I muſt give a little farther account of the time when this ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my appears, which is the laſt ſcene of the Churches troubles, and is to bring on the laſt deſtruction of theſe enemies, to think therefore that the Churches ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies ſhould be all deſtroyed before <hi>Gog</hi> and <hi>Magog</hi> appears, is to leave no <hi>Gog</hi> and <hi>Magog</hi> to vex the Church, and to think that by the deciſion of the battel of the white horſe, all the Antichriſtian party are de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyed,
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:57576:95"/>is all one as to leave no <hi>Gog</hi> and <hi>Magog</hi> in the earth to act this laſt ſcene, for to imagine a fort of enemies to be rais'd from the ſides of the earth, that never yet appeared againſt Chriſt and his intereſt, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides, that it is vain and groundleſs, is expreſly contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to the text in <hi>Ezekiel,</hi> that ſays, it is a known ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, and an enemy that watches the ways of the Church, ſees and obſerves how things go, and takes his advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tages of their ſecurity (and ſinful diviſions parhaps) <hi>Ezek,</hi> 38.17. compar'd with <hi>v.</hi> 14. and <hi>v.</hi> 11. But though it ſhould be granted, that this enemy is a ſtump of Antichriſt, yet it is certain, great execution muſt be done upon that intereſt, &amp; great deliverance thence wrought for the Church before this action of <hi>Gog</hi> and <hi>Magog,</hi> therefore the queſtion ſeems to be whether thoſe ſcenes be over, that are to precede this, and particularly whether the judgment of <hi>Babilon</hi> be over.</p>
               <p>To this I anſwer, that I conceive it may be made out, that the judgment of <hi>Babilon</hi> that precedes, this at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt of <hi>Gog</hi> and <hi>Magog,</hi> is but a miſtical judgment, and that the judgment hath been executed upon, <hi>Babi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lon</hi> by miſtical judgment, I mean ſuch whether out ward or in ward, as which not withſtanding ſhe continues and bears up in her pride and oppoſition untill the laſt Vy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al, tis manifeſt ſhe doth, and yet (beſides the former Vyals in elder times) I conceive there would be no great difficulty to prove the the 5 Vyal, being a miſtical fulfilling of that 18th <hi>chap.</hi> that continues <hi>Babilons</hi> judgment to have been poured forth upon her, and as little difficult to point out the time and place, when, and, where it was fulfilled to the filling of the kingdom of the beaſt full of darkneſs, making the Marchants of
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:57576:96"/>
                  <hi>Babiton</hi> to mourn, &amp; her merchandiſe to become of no more eſteem, which though it hath not yet been done in <hi>Rome,</hi> the Metropolis of the Antichriſtian <hi>Babilon,</hi> (who with all her profeſſed daughters, adorers, and worſhipers awaits the laſt Vyal) yet hath been done in ſome kingdoms of the reformation, who, as at firſt they caſt out the beaſts name, yet retained the tanta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mount or number of his name, ſo ſince, even in this our age have experienced this 5th Vyal upon the throne or government of the beaſt, wherein <hi>Rome</hi> it ſelf was concerned, and had an earneſt of her own payment, which is not farr off (for when God judges one, he mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtieally judgeth all that are in the ſame ſpirit, and if it be done thus <hi>to the green tree, what ſhall be done to the dry?</hi>) and then when that time comes, ſhall great <hi>Babilon, Rome</hi> her ſelf come into remembrance before God, <hi>to give unto her the cup of the wine of the fierceneſs of his wrath;</hi> to the fulfilling of every Jota of her de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced judgment, in the very letter and rigour of it, and then ſhall the citties of the nations that bear up with her, in her pride, idolatries, and cruelties whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Popiſh or Mahometan, fall with her.</p>
               <p>And that there is not much time for theſe things to be brought to paſs, <hi>Daniel</hi> ſhews, caſting up the times from <hi>Julian</hi> (when the laſt attempt was made for reſtoring Judaiſme, in oppoſition to chriſtianity) of which time, to his laſt period there temains not above 22 years, pitching the Epocha in 360. as Mr. <hi>Brightman</hi> hath demonſtrated out of <hi>Onuphirius:</hi> For <hi>Conſtantin</hi> began his raign <hi>Ann.</hi> 304. reigned 31 years, <hi>Conſtantius</hi> after him raigned 24 years, next ſucceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed <hi>Julian,</hi> who raigned only a year, and ſome few months, which all put together making but 56 years,

                  </gap> of the time when this enemy is to appear, I come to a 3d character in <hi>Ezekiel,</hi> which is, that this enemy and his action, is ſuch as upon which the other bordering enemies of the Church have their eye and great expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctation, rejovcing much in it; ſo we reade <hi>Ezek.</hi> 38.13. <hi>Sheba,</hi> and <hi>Dedan, and the Marchants of</hi> Tarſhiſh, <hi>with all the young Lyons thereof, ſhall ſay unto thee</hi> (i. e.) to <hi>Gog,</hi> art <hi>thou come to take a ſpoile, haſt thou gathered thy company to take a prey, to carry away ſilver and gold, to take away catile, and goods, to take a great ſpoile,</hi> the phraſe imports a pleaſure and ſecret tickling thy ſelf to ſee this enemy up, they clap him on the back, they ſet him on, and give him their curſed benediction in the work, thus much for the characters.</p>
               <p>I come next to the effect, and the deſigne thereof, Gods deſigne is one thing, and the Dragons is ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, the Dragons deſigne is to retrive and bring back the Church that is upon her eſcape, and well advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced, to bring her back into his power, and clutches a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain, into a worſe condition then before, and to keep her for over there, and to prevent her new <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> eſtate ſo neer at hand, which though impoſſible, yet this mad ſpirit not believing what he cannot but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve, will be trying, though he be ſure to pay dear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly for it at laſt, but Gods deſigne is only a tryal up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on his people for moſt holy and glorious ends, ſet be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore us; we may judge of the degree, to which God may ſuffer this tryal to proceed.</p>

               <p> God hath a 3 fold end in this ſcene.</p>

               <p>And not to inſtance in any more, the Apoſtle <hi>Peter</hi> ſpeaks of this laſt ſhock as being common to all the Saints, both to the collective body, and the particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar members, and therefore adviſeth us <hi>not to think it ſtrange concerning the fiery tryal,</hi> as if he pointed to this red fiery dragon) <hi>as though ſome ſtrange thing hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened unto us,</hi> 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 4.12. for it is not to deſtroy their faith, but only to try it, as he had acquainted them, <hi>Chap.</hi> 1.7. and ſo our Saviour ſecures <hi>Peter,</hi> and in him ſecures all that are built on that rock, that <hi>Peter</hi> was <hi>Simon: Satan hath deſired to winnow thee, bnt I have prayed that thy faith fail not, Luk.</hi> 22.31. neither did <hi>Jacobs</hi> faith fail him in that night of his conflict, <hi>Gen.</hi> 32.25. nor <hi>Jobs</hi> while he could make ſuch a glorious confeſſion <hi>chap.</hi> 19.23.27. neither did <hi>Davids</hi> faith fail him, though it was ſhaken and ſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to fail when he ſaid, <hi>I ſhall one day periſh by the hand of Saul,</hi> 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 27.1. yet we read afterwards, <hi>he en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couraged himſelf in the Lord his God.</hi> 1. <hi>Sam.</hi> 30.6. it is ſaid <hi>the powers of heaven ſhall be ſhaken,</hi> and ſo may faith be ſhaken but ſhall not fail: <hi>Gog</hi> &amp; <hi>Magog</hi> ſhall compaſs the camp of the Saints, on every ſide, ſo that
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:57576:98"/>which way ſoever they look, there is nothing but danger and ſear, this will make all things fail, but faith (as <hi>David</hi> ſaith) <hi>my heart and fleſh faileth, but God is the ſtrength of my heart,</hi> it will put even faith if ſelf to it, and drive it into God, where properly it is to dwell.</p>
               <p>How great this tryal is like to be may be gueſſed from theſe conſiderations.</p>
               <p n="1">1. That it is the laſt, and dying effect of the Dra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gons cauſe, therefore, his rage is great, ſaith the text, <hi>knowing he hath but a ſhort time,</hi> after which he hath no more that he can do.</p>
               <p n="2">2. He acts from deſperation, and though he cannot hope to prevail, yet he will ſet his life as dear as he can, and make it as coſtly and bloudy a victory to the Church, as God will ſuffer him, for no other bounds will be ſet to bloody rage, then the reſtraint God lays upon him, who in his holy counſel, permits him to go as far as may be with the ſafety of the cauſe, and intereſt, and the faith of the Church, which is to be a full tryal of it, and of their patience, that it may have it's perfect work, and that the glory of that tryal may be the greater, as we may ſee in <hi>Job,</hi> the Devil had full ſcope to all manner tryals, his life only ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted, ſo the Church ſhall live, and that is all, till this tryal is over, therefore the Lord ſets this bound, <hi>Eſay.</hi> 57.56. <hi>Leſt the ſpirit fail before me,</hi> and in ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther place, <hi>leſt the righteous put forth their hand to ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity, Pſa.</hi> 125.3. they ſhall almoſt come to it, but there it ſhall ſtop.</p>
               <p>A ſecond end of god in this tryal is to bring upon the Church (Chriſts miſtical body) that needful qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lification and preparation for glory that God wrote
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:57576:99"/>upon Chriſt the head: to make them conformable to him, according to the law of his eternal counſel, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.29. for even Chriſt was made perfect by ſufferings, <hi>being crucified through weakneſs,</hi> or for the weakneſs of that ſtate he was in, in the fleſh, which could not work out redemption for us, without it's paſſing a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way, and the Apoſtle tells us all, after that law and example, <hi>that fleſh and blood cannot inherit the kingdom of God,</hi> this miſtical death therefore is to rid us of our ſelves, and thoſe foul mixtures, which made our for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer works miſcarry, and prove abortive, as the ſnake preſſing between ſharp (tones or rocks, puts off her old skin, and renews (as the Eagle by caſting her bill) ſo God uſeth the miniſtry of Satan himſelf in theſe ſharp tryals to help us off with the old man, for it is a new race of Chriſtians or Chriſtians new formed, regenerated, ſpirited, that are fit for the new <hi>Jeruſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem,</hi> and all this would not do to fit us for converſe with Chriſt, and that heavenly company, if the Lord did not put to his own hand at laſt, in that change, in a moment, in the twinckling of an eye, but theſe tribula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions help, that is the 2d end.</p>
               <p>The third is, that the Lord may take occaſion by this freſh and bleeding diſcovery of the ſerpent and his parties enmity to deſtroy them, and deliver the Church from them for ever, they have given occaſion and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocation enough all along, and God hath rapt them for it, but deferr'd his anger till this time, giving the Church ſupport, mean while, as not having finiſhed his work on <hi>Mount Sion,</hi> and ſo former provocations ſlept, and were forgotten, but for the glory of Gods righteouſneſſe, and to make his juſtice the more con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpicuous, he permits them this laft opportunity to ſhew
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:57576:99"/>themſelves, which they do to the full, that God may take them in the fact while they are reaking hot in their rage againſt the Church, that all the world may ſee for what it is he deſtroys them, and how he favours the Church which the world could not well read in for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer diſpenſations, they were ſo intermingled, but now the <hi>viſion ſhall be ſo plain that he may run that reads it,</hi> this is the account which the Lord himſelf gives of this diſpenſation, <hi>Zeph.</hi> 3.8. <hi>therefore wait ye upon me</hi> faith the Lord <hi>till I riſe up to the prey, for my determina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is to gather the nations that I may aſſemble the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms to pour upon them my indignation, even all my fierce anger,</hi> and <hi>Ier.</hi> 51.39. <hi>In their beat I will make their feaſts, and I will make them drunken that they may re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyce, and ſleep a perpetual ſleep, and not awake ſaith the Lord;</hi> God will give them all the ſcope their hearts can deſire, power &amp; multitudes to excecute their will, and no power with the Church, and then will God triumph over them, as in the day of <hi>Iehoſaphat,</hi> and the day of <hi>Gideon</hi> call'd the <hi>day of Midian,</hi> and the <hi>day of battel, Zach.</hi> 14.3. <hi>Eſa.</hi> 10.26. <hi>Mich.</hi> 4.11.12.13. There are many other holy and gracious ends the Lord hath in this diſpenſation, might be inſtanced as to commend the following reſt and glory, therefore the Lord continues to take his people juſt off a troubleſom and tempeſt uous ſea into it, that they may have the fuller, and more perfect relliſh of it, which to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timate to us ſeems to be conſulted in that manner of phraſe in <hi>Peter,</hi> where he ſpeaks of the ſpirit, his <hi>teſtifying in the prophets beforehand of the ſuffering of Chriſt, and the glory that ſhould follow,</hi> as much as to intimate, that the ſufferings are ordain'd among other and great ends, as a foil to the glory.
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:57576:100"/>
               </p>
               <p>But I haſten to the concluſion of this diſcourſe, there is one point I would ſpeak more fully to, and that is to give in fuller evidence and ſatisfaction, that the times of the 5th trumpet are not to be ranged ſo high as interpreters commonly carry them, but to belong to the times of Satan looſed, which having ſlipt the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per place to bring it in, <hi>I</hi> ſhall therefore add it, at the cloſe of this diſcourſe, and therewith ſhall alſo offer a paper which I drew ſome months ſince, whereby the main ſubject of this diſcourſe may receive ſome fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther light, in the mean ſpace I ſhall ſpeak a word as to the aplication of the precedent diſcourſe to the times, and to the particular concern of the people of God in theſe times.</p>
               <p n="1">1. As to the times, the deſigne of this ſhort diſcourſe hath been, to give or get ſome light to diſcern the times, and to give ſome account why things go as they do in the world; if the devil be let looſe is it any won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, if <hi>Gog and Magog</hi> be upon the ſtage? may we not wonder rather if we ſcape thus? confider the evidence that hath been offered (and what more follows at the end of theſe papers) from the calculation of the time, from the deſcription of the enemy, from the likeneſs of the action, from the opening of the deſign both of God and Satan, and the parallel between the diſpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation of God to particular believers, and the whole collective body of the Church, which you have in the foregoing diſcourſe; to gird which a little cloſer to you, take theſe two notes.</p>
               <p n="1">1. That as it is but a miſtical reign that the Church hath, till Chriſts glorious appearing, ſo it is but a miſtical judgment that is executed upon <hi>Babilon,</hi> or any of the Churches enemies till then, elſe how ſhould
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:57576:100"/>the <hi>day of the Lord come as a thief, and fall as a ſnare on all that dwell on the earth,</hi> as it is ſaid it ſhall. The not conſidering this, makes us overlook the Vyals, when they are before us; it is true it is ſaid, at the pouring out of the Vyals, his judgments are made manifeſt, but to whom are they made manifeſt? will not the wicked do wickedly ſtill to the laſt? muſt not the Lord, even Chriſt at his appearing fetch the laſt blow himſelf at the wicked one? therefore let us not think becauſe a Pope lives ſtill at <hi>Rome,</hi> and a grand Signieur at <hi>Adrianople,</hi> that therefore we are not near the finiſhing of the miſtery of God.</p>
               <p>By a miſtical judgment I mean cloſe and dark judgments, ſuch as take them not off their violence, but heighten and harden them the more, ſuch the judgment executed by the Vyals ſeems to be; and therefore by the <hi>5th</hi> Vyal on the throne of the beaſt, his kingdom is obſerved to be full of darkneſs, and ſo little did the Antichriſtian party profit by that, or any of the precedent Vyals, that we fiud them under the next Vyal, uniting and making head more ſtre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nouſly and univerſally then ever before; like <hi>Pharoah,</hi> that by every judgment was more and more hardened, not but that God hath all along given, many evident teſtimonies of his diſpleaſure againſt them, which thoſe that have eyes, ſee, but they ſee it not, or at leaſt lay it not to heart to repent, but are unjuſt and filthy ſtill, or as that word <hi>(ſtill)</hi> may import are more and more filthy and unjuſt, there in diſcovering the judgment to be upon their heart, and thus it appears to me, it will be till Chriſt fetcheth his laſt and diſpatching blow at them, and then they will ſee and be confounded.</p>
               <p>My ſecond note is this, that there may be a great
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:57576:101"/>miſtake in expecting thoſe eminent ſcenes (in the laſt times of the beaſt) <hi>viz.</hi> the ſlaughter and riſing of the witneſſes, the battel againſt him that ſate on the white horſe, or the gathering to <hi>Armageddon,</hi> and the viſible effects of the Vyals (eſpecially the ſix firſt Vyals, and ſo this attempt of <hi>Gog</hi> and <hi>Magog</hi>) ſhould equally ſhew themſelves in all the parts and places of the beaſts dominion; it is ſufficient for this miſtical way of judging, if the Lord ſingle out ſome head-place, ſome eminent part of his juridiction (that is or hath been ſo) and there preſent them at leaſt more eminently, thus <hi>Ezek.</hi> 5.5.8. <hi>God did ſet</hi> Jeruſalem <hi>in the midſt of the nations, and did execute judgment in her, in the ſight of the nations, and for their inſtructions,</hi> this ſuits the way and manner of God, who is one, to judge, and ſave in one, as he did in Chriſt.</p>
               <p>Therefore, though the witneſſes have been ſpread all over the juridiction of <hi>Babilon,</hi> and have prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cyed, and have been ſlayn by coaſt, as I may ſay, in all her ſtreets, yet the laſt and eminent ſettling of the cloud, ſeems to be in one particular ſtreet or province, and there their viſible reſurrection alſo to be, which is called <hi>the tenth part of the citty,</hi> and ſo the battel of <hi>Armageddon</hi> for the ſubſtance thereof (without that ſpecialty) hath been fought by parties throughout the whole juriſdiction, but the laſt and great daſh of that ſhour, may be found to have lighted on ſome parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular place more eminently, and that is like to be, or to have been, on the head kingdom, or kingdoms of the Reformation, and where that hath been, there in probability, it is, that the Dragon will ſecond the worſted beaſt &amp; his party, with his ſuccors of <hi>Gog</hi> and <hi>Magog.</hi> Theſe are my 2 notes, which being premiſed
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:57576:101"/>I conclude, that it is profitable; that this is the time of <hi>Gog</hi> and <hi>Magog,</hi> my reaſon in brief is, for that there ſeems to me ſo little time yet to run out before the white throne be erected, ſo little time that this old world hath to continue, my confidence ariſes from thoſe num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hers pitch't by the Lord himſelf, <hi>Dan.</hi> 12.11.12. the one of 1290 days, the other of 1335 days; the 45 years in the laſt number exceeding the former I look upon to be the time allotted for this expedition of <hi>Gog</hi> and <hi>Magog,</hi> the one half of which 45 years is expired: now let us but conſider how much work is left for the other half that is to come, the Jews are to be called and brought to their own land, they are there to be ſettled, and to get goods, and cattel, yea gold and ſilver in abundance, and to live in great ſecurity, before the Eaſtern <hi>Gog</hi> is let looſe up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on them, which for a people ſo ſpoiled, and that are to begin the world again, as the greateſt part of the twelve tribes are preſumed to be, may well require half of the time that is behind, and then after the deſtruction of <hi>Gog</hi> and <hi>Magog,</hi> they are to be ſeven years burning the wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pons of warr, all this probably before the coming down of the new <hi>Jeruſalem:</hi> therefore, by this, judge wherea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bouts we are, <hi>Daniel</hi> is promiſed to riſe and ſtand up in the latter end of thoſe days, thoſe days come up 22 years hence (there is not much difference among Chronolo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers) all interpreters agree in the Epocha, and fix it in <hi>Julians</hi> time, all this work is to be done among the Jews ere that time, is it not time therefore for us to expect their call and return?</p>
               <p>Our weſtern <hi>Gog</hi> and <hi>Magog</hi> probably may not ſtay for them, but may lead the way, and be a means of their awakning; for the Apoſile intimates that <hi>through our mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy they ſhall obtain mercy,</hi> which probably muſt be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood of ſome eminent ſignal mercy, farther then hath
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:57576:102"/>yet been ſeen upon us, by the reviving the work, and cauſe of God among the Gentiles, and the deciding the controverſy that hath been ſo long depending between Chriſt and Antichriſt, wherein this <hi>Gog</hi> and <hi>Magog</hi> is Antichriſts laſt reſerve. Now there being ſo little ſand in the glaſs, it is very pardonable to expect theſe actions and iſſues which muſt ſhew themſelves before that little ſand be run out, and as this late time hath been full of wonders, this might be reckoned among them as one, to be too early with our expectations or obſervations, it having been the common fault of all times hitherto to lagg and come behind, and it were very ſtrange, if any of us in this ſleepy age ſhould be up, and ſtirring before the Lord is ſtirring, for my part, I cannot think it.</p>
               <p>I ſhall ſhut up this point with this one note, referring the reader to what farther he ſhall find in the end of this diſcourſe, the <hi>11th</hi> of the <hi>Rev.</hi> which gives us a chro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nology of the whole time and tryal of the Church, from the race of Antichriſt, to the <hi>7th</hi> trumpet, gives us no ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectation of any long time of exerciſe after the reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection and aſcention of the witneſſes, but only the third wo which it is there ſaid, <hi>comes quickly,</hi> and will likely as quickly paſs away, which third wo can be nothing but this <hi>Gog</hi> and <hi>Magog.</hi> Now that the witneſſes are riſen and aſcended, may I conceive be made out, both from the time allotted for that ſcene, and from the evidence of the thing it ſelf when it appeared, for the time it muſt be at and with the expiring of the 41 months of the beaſt, which 42 months good meaſure preſſed down, and run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing over, and above a hundred years to ſpare, may be put to the account of the beaſt, if we ſhould reckon from the downful of heatheniſme, at <hi>Conſtantines</hi> coming to the Empire, but I pitch the Epocha and commencement of his 42 months, <hi>Anno</hi> 390 (in that laſt expiring of the
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:57576:102"/>Dragons cauſe by the diſcomfiture of <hi>Eugenius</hi> by <hi>Theo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doſius</hi>) which came up in 1650. at or before which time I queſtion not may be proved the witneſſes were riſen and aſcended to a heaven of reſt and glory, to which they were called by a great voice from heaven, as by a calm and unprejudiced reflection on times, not out of our re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance might be inſtanced, when a ſcone of this na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture (not in one or two particulars, but in all circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances throughout, ſo paraiel, that an exacter portra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cter of the viſion could not be drawn) did preſent it ſelf, therefore that ſcene being over, what can any wo ſince be other then that of <hi>Gog</hi> and <hi>Magog.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>My 2d word therſore is to the people of God in reſpect of their ſpiritual and inward affairs and concernes, it ſerves both to give them account of what hath befalne them, and to adviſe them both what to expect, and what to do.</p>
               <p n="1">1. By way of account, it hath been ſuch a time of try<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al and troubles upon the ſaints, in reſpect of their own particulars, as well as the publike, within as well as with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out, as I think no former experience can paraiel, what with ſtrange ſpirits, falſe Chriſts, and falſe prophets, and danger of ſeduction and deluſion thereby, what with horrible temptations carried on with ſuch artifice and cunning, ſuch deluſive power not to be reſiſted, wherein theſe ſpirits of darkneſs have been ſo far ſucceſsful, to make ſuch impreſſions, as have captivated multitudes, hurried more, and diſtracted ſomewhat with the ſhock of terrible outward diſpenſations by perſecutions, loſſes, tryals of all ſorts, and that which hath added to the hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror of all, hath been the darkneſs of the diſpenſation, that they have not known what to call it, nor upon what ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count to put theſe things which now begins, and I am perſwaded will every day more and more go on to clear
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:57576:103"/>up to be upon the account of the Devil let looſe, and to be their particular ſhare with the publick intereſt of Chriſt in this tryal by <hi>Gog</hi> and <hi>Magog.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. By way of advice, it ſerves to teach us what to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect till this ſcone be over, to direct us what to do, and to comfort us in what ſhall follow, firſt expect all that an enraged enemy the Dragon with all his inſtruments can do, to the utmoſt of their line, to make your lives uncom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortable, and to drive you to utter deſpair; we read under the <hi>5th</hi> trumpet when the Locuſts firſt came forth of the bottomleſs pit, that ſo great would be the tryal and tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, that <hi>men ſhould ſeek death &amp; deſire to dye. Re.</hi> 9.6. if in thoſe days under the firſt wo, what in theſe days under the laſt wo? both <hi>Jeremy, Daniel, Joel,</hi> the prophets, the Apoſtles, Chriſt himſelf, all acquaint us, it will be a day none like it, of ſuch tribulation, that men ſhall be diſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, walk up and down like Ghoſts and ſhadows: yet be not diſmaid, for as our Saviour ſaid in the caſe of <hi>Laza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rus, this ſickneſs is not unto death, but for the glory of God, and for your glory, when God hath ſiniſhed his work upon</hi> Mount Sion, <hi>when patience hath had it's perfect work</hi> Therefore the direction is, act faith in God under this diſpenſation, let your eye be on the deſigne of God; which is your mercy, your glory; ſee every tryal, every thing ordain'd to ſerve and promote this deſigne, anoint the means by faith, that they may attain their end, or ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Gods end upon them, offer up your ſelves to God under this death, this tryal, to be regenerated, to be made new, to be fitted for the kingdom, expect ſuch a gracious working of your tryals, not from your ſelves, nor any grace in your ſelves, but from the grace of God, his co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant of grace; our former works miſcarried becauſe wrote much in our own ſpirit, therefore the Lord hath taken the work into his own hands, hath laid by man and
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:57576:103"/>every creature that he may work all himſelf, and have all the glory, and his work ſhall abide, this is the direction, the comfort follows, firſt this is the laſt enemy, and this is the laſt ſhock, by this enemy, the <hi>laſt enemy is death,</hi> if this enemy be not called death, and ſignaliſed by that name, <hi>Eſa.</hi> 25. as the type of him is, <hi>Eſa.</hi> 28.15. yet death and the Dragon, or the devil that hath the power of death fall together, <hi>Rev.</hi> 20. for no ſooner is the devil caſt into the lake, but <hi>the white throne appears,</hi> and by the judgment of the white throne, <hi>death and hell are caſt into the lake, ſo that the ſaints after</hi> that, ſhall be troubled with death and hell no more, neither death corporal nor death ſpiritual.</p>
               <p>And what follows then but the new heaven, and the <hi>new earth, and the new Jeruſalem,</hi> a new world, and all things therein new.</p>
               <p>But you will ſay, we muſt paſſe through a ſore fiery tryal firſt, but ſtill remember, it ſhall be but a tryal, the <hi>devil ſhall compaſſe the camp of the Saints,</hi> but ſhall not car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry his deſign, no more then the Sodomites did, that com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſed <hi>Lots</hi> houſe, fire ſhall come down from God out of heaven, and feed on them; you reade how by the 7th Vy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al the great c<gap reason="illegible: faint" extent="1+ letters">

And for the outward part of this wo, if this be the ſame time ſpoken of, <hi>Rev.</hi> 12.15.16. as I have formerly hinted in this diſcourſe it is, the earth ſhall help the woman, and open her mouth to ſwallow up the flood, as we may ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve it hath done thus farr hitherto.</p>
               <p>But yet there is more comfort behinde, for as in this

So that here is all the comfort can be deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, the very action is a ſervice to us, to bring us to God, and the iſſue will crown our joy in bringing down Chriſt unto us, look on the deliverance of <hi>Let</hi> and <hi>Sodom,</hi> the very type of this, where you may finde all the parts, and the whole contexture of this ſcene, even to the fire that came down from heaven, and the lake into which thoſe filthy citties were caſt, but juſt <hi>Lot</hi> is delivered, and the Lord appears in perſon to his deliverance, look on the old world another figure of this, all drowned, but upright <hi>Noah</hi> ſaved in the Ark, ſo ſhall it be with the Lords <hi>Noahs</hi> and <hi>Lots</hi> in this day, when the enemy ſhall come in like a flood, and when the Lord ſhall ſend his flood of his wrath upon them, nay when he ſhall rain down fire from heaven upon them, therefore his is the Lords call, this day to his <hi>Lots,</hi> to his <hi>Noahs,</hi> to abandon <hi>Sodom,</hi> to flee out of <hi>Babylon,</hi> and to deliver every man his own ſou; let the Churches hear this, and all that walk with them to ariſe, and depart out of every form and appearance of things, of holy things, Church or ordinancé, that is pollu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, that is deſtitute of the ſpirit, where Chriſt, and his ſpirit is not in rule, in power, is not predominant, ſtriks not the great ſtroke, bears not the great ſway, that ſtate of things is a <hi>Sodom,</hi> and <hi>Egypt,</hi> a <hi>Babilon,</hi> it is not ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of God, or ſomething of the ſpirit being there, makes it otherwiſe, if the ſpirit be not there in rule and dominion; God knows how to ſave that ſomething, and will do it, as he did <hi>Lot</hi> out of <hi>Sodom,</hi> but that ſhall not ſave <hi>Sodom.</hi> It is true, the laſt Vyal is poured out upon the air, the prince of the power of the air, and his whole
